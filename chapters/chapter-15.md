# Chapter 15: Shelly's Defense

Shelly had been lying to herself for two days.

She knew it now, sitting in the bunkhouse as dawn light filtered through frost-covered windows. Knew she'd been defending Raymond not because the evidence was unclear, but because accepting the truth would break something inside her she didn't think could be repaired.

The Night Caller had saved her life. Not literally—she'd never been in physical danger. But emotionally, psychologically, Raymond's voice had been the thing that got her through the worst years.

Mother's constant criticism. The suffocating small town where everyone knew she'd never amount to anything. The loneliness of working graveyard shifts at the bank, coming home to an empty apartment, eating dinner alone, sleeping alone, existing alone.

Until she'd discovered The Night Caller.

Raymond's voice in the darkness. Warm, understanding, intimate. Like he was speaking directly to her. Every song choice felt personal. Every late-night monologue about loneliness and connection—it was like he saw into her soul.

She'd fallen in love. Not romantic love exactly, though sometimes it felt like that. More like... finding the one person in the world who understood her. Who made her feel seen. Important. Worth something.

For three years, Raymond's show had been her companion. Her comfort. Her reason to get through each day.

And now they were telling her he was a monster.

"Shelly." Marie's voice, gentle but firm. "We need to talk about this."

"I don't want to," Shelly said.

"I know. But hiding won't change the facts."

The facts. Shelly hated that word. Facts were cold, clinical, without room for feeling or hope or the desperate need for things to be different than they were.

"You don't understand," Shelly said. "None of you understand what his show meant to me."

"I think I do," Jack said quietly. He'd been kind throughout, never mocking her devotion. "Radio creates connection. That's its power. Raymond knew that. He exploited it."

"He didn't exploit anything. He gave me comfort. Made me feel less alone."

"By pretending to be something he wasn't," Marie said.

"You don't know that! You're assuming the worst because of—because of coincidences and circumstantial—"

"Shelly." Marie opened her bag, pulled out photographs. "Look at these."

Shelly didn't want to. But Marie held them out, persistent, and eventually Shelly's eyes went to the images despite herself.

Polaroids. People smiling with Raymond at the station. Then the same people in graves.

"No," Shelly whispered.

"Jennifer Holcomb. David Monroe. Fifty-one others. Photographed alive and dead. This isn't circumstantial."

Shelly's hands shook. She'd seen some of this yesterday, heard the awful tape recording of Raymond killing David. But she'd pushed it away, retreated into denial. Now, forced to look directly at the evidence, she felt her defenses crumbling.

"Maybe... maybe he only kept pictures of people who died naturally. To remember them. That doesn't prove—"

"Listen to this." Marie pulled out her notebook, read from Raymond's technical notes. "'Subject should be comfortable initially. Record minimum four to six hours before revelation. Capture full emotional range: joy, sadness, fear, anger, pleading. Sedation timing critical.'" She looked up. "He wrote instructions for murder, Shelly. Step by step. Like a recipe."

"Stop."

"He documented everything. Selection criteria, preservation methods, burial locations. This isn't speculation. It's his handwriting."

"I said stop!"

Shelly stood, pacing, hands over her ears like a child. She couldn't hear this. Couldn't accept it. Because if Raymond was a killer, if his show was a lie, if three years of comfort and connection were built on murder—

What did that make her?

"How could I not know?" she asked quietly. "I listened every night. Every single night for three years. How could I love something created by a monster?"

Jack approached carefully. "Because the show itself wasn't evil. The music, the voice, the companionship—those were real. What wasn't real was Raymond's intention behind them."

"That doesn't make sense."

"It does. Raymond created genuine intimacy. That's why it worked. But he created it to lure victims, not to help lonely people. The comfort was real. The purpose was evil. Both things can be true."

Shelly wanted to argue but couldn't find words. She sank back onto the bunk, feeling hollowed out.

"I told everyone about him," she said. "At work, at home. Talked about The Night Caller like it was the most important thing in my life. And people thought I was pathetic. Obsessed with some radio DJ I'd never met. They were right, weren't they?"

"No," Jack said. "You formed a parasocial relationship with a media figure. That's incredibly common. People connect with podcasters, radio hosts, TV personalities. It's normal human behavior."

"But I took it further. Entered contests every week. Wrote letters. Planned my life around broadcast times." Shelly laughed bitterly. "I told my mother I couldn't have Sunday dinners anymore because The Night Caller was on. She said I was choosing a stranger over family. And I said yes, because Raymond understood me and she never did."

She looked at the others, saw pity in their eyes. That was somehow worse than mockery.

"I'm the girl who loved a serial killer," she said. "That's what people will say. That I was so desperate, so lonely, so pathetic that I fell in love with a monster."

"You didn't know," Marie said.

"Does that matter? I defended him. Yesterday, when you were showing me evidence, I argued with you. Called you paranoid. Insisted Raymond was good. I fought for him."

"Because he manipulated you," Jack said. "This is what predators do. They create trust, build connection, make themselves seem safe. You weren't stupid. You were targeted."

But Shelly couldn't accept that. Accepting it meant she'd been a victim. Prey. Someone so desperate for connection that she'd been easy to manipulate.

Maybe she was pathetic.

"The contest entry," she said quietly. "When I won, I cried. Actual tears of joy. Told my mother this was the best thing that ever happened to me. Coming here to meet Raymond, to thank him personally for years of companionship."

"He selected you deliberately," Marie said, pulling out the contest files. "Your application had notes. 'Devoted fan, emotionally vulnerable, ideal voice.' You weren't random. He chose you."

To kill me, Shelly finished silently. Raymond had read her application—probably all those letters she'd sent over the years—and decided her voice was worth preserving. Worth murdering for.

She thought about what that meant. About how Raymond had evaluated her, studied her loneliness, decided she was perfect material.

"What did he want from me?" she asked. "What did my annotation say exactly?"

Marie hesitated.

"Tell me."

"'Shelly Vaughn—devoted fan, calls weekly, lonely. Voice: beautiful soprano, emotional range, genuine warmth. Psychological profile: parasocial attachment to show, seeks connection, vulnerable to manipulation. Perfect victim—trusting, emotionally dependent on The Night Caller, unlikely to resist. Risk minimal.'"

Each word landed like a blow.

Beautiful voice. Vulnerable to manipulation. Perfect victim.

Raymond had assessed her like livestock. Found her acceptable for slaughter.

And she would have gone willingly. If he'd been here when they arrived, if he'd greeted them personally with that warm voice and understanding smile, she would have trusted him completely. Would have drunk whatever he offered. Would have sat in his recording chair, happy to be part of the show.

Would have died without ever understanding what happened.

"I'm not helping," Shelly said abruptly.

The others looked at her, confused.

"Helping with what?" Jack asked.

"Evidence. Planning. Escape. I can't." She stood, moved to the window. "You're organizing files and building timelines and preparing to testify. And I can't be part of that. Because every piece of evidence you find is another reminder that I loved him. That I was too stupid to see the truth."

"Shelly—"

"No. You don't understand. You all came here as investigators, skeptics. Leon thought it was conspiracy, Marie wanted research, Jack and Paulie were curious about the technology. But me?" She turned to face them. "I came here because I was in love. With a voice. With an idea of connection I thought was real."

"That doesn't make you complicit," Marie said.

"Doesn't it? I heard families complaining on FCC reports that they heard dead relatives' voices. And I thought they were crazy. I thought Raymond was too good, too pure, to do something wrong. I dismissed victims' families as delusional."

She had. Reading through Marie's files earlier, she'd seen names she recognized—callers she'd heard on broadcasts. And when their families filed complaints saying those people were dead, Shelly had mentally dismissed them.

Grief made people hear things that weren't there.

Except the families had been right.

"I can't help you build the case against him," Shelly said finally. "Because part of me still doesn't want to believe it. Part of me is still looking for ways he could be innocent. And that's dangerous. I'll contaminate evidence or miss things or subconsciously sabotage because I can't let go of the lie."

"What will you do?" Paulie asked.

"Stay out of the way. When we leave, I'll walk with you. When we reach police, I'll tell them what I saw. But I won't organize evidence or testify enthusiastically or help build the narrative. I'll just... exist on the periphery. Where I can't do damage."

It felt like giving up. Like admitting defeat. But Shelly didn't trust herself anymore. Couldn't trust her judgment, her instincts, her understanding of people.

She'd been so wrong about Raymond.

What else was she wrong about?

"I'm sorry," she said quietly. "I know you needed me to be stronger. To help. But I can't. I'm too broken."

Jack moved beside her at the window. "You're not broken. You're human. You formed an attachment to someone who seemed trustworthy. That's not weakness. That's hope."

"Hope that got me selected for murder."

"Hope that made you survive loneliness without giving up completely. Don't let Raymond's evil poison the legitimate need for connection that brought you to his show."

Shelly wanted to believe him. But right now, she couldn't separate the comfort she'd found from the horror that created it.

Maybe in time. Maybe after testimony and trials and justice. Maybe after years of therapy and distance.

But not today.

Today she was just a lonely girl who loved a monster.

And she would have to live with that.

Outside, full dawn arrived. Light spreading across the mountain, burning away shadows. Time to leave. Time to escape and report and end Raymond's twenty-year collection.

Shelly gathered her few possessions, checked her bag.

She'd come here with hope. She was leaving with shame.

But at least she was leaving alive.

Unlike the fifty-three people whose voices Raymond had loved enough to preserve forever.
