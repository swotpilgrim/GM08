# Chapter 18: Psychological Warfare

Jack sat alone in the broadcast booth, headphones cupping his ears, watching the turntable spin. The Everly Brothers faded out. Three seconds of dead air. His moment.

He'd spent hours thinking about what to say. How to reach someone who'd spent twenty years perfecting his delusion. Every DJ knew the trick—make your voice intimate, personal, like you're speaking to one listener instead of thousands. Create the illusion of connection. Raymond had weaponized that technique. Now Jack would use it against him.

He opened the microphone.

"Raymond." His voice went out across three states, interrupting the carefully programmed broadcast. He kept his tone gentle, measured. The voice he used for his graveyard shift at college when lonely callers needed someone to talk to. "I know you're listening. You've been listening to us since we arrived. The hidden microphones. The cameras. You know we found everything."

Through the booth window, he could see the others in the equipment room. Paulie working on the transmitter with careful hands. Marie documenting. Leon monitoring. Shelly sitting against the wall, arms wrapped around herself. They'd agreed: give Jack twelve minutes. One song length. See if he could provoke Raymond into responding, revealing his location, his plans.

"I've been thinking about what you said in your journals," Jack continued. "About Margaret. About how her death taught you what silence means. You recorded one phone call with her. Just one. And you played it until the tape wore out, until her voice started to degrade, bits of her disappearing into static."

He paused, letting the silence fill the airwaves. DJs learned to use silence the way musicians used rests. Empty space created tension, made listeners lean in.

"That must have been terrifying," Jack said softly. "Realizing you were losing her again. The tape degrading meant Margaret was dying a second time. So you built this station. Found a way to preserve voices perfectly, indefinitely. Reel-to-reel tape, professional equipment, climate-controlled storage. You made sure no one else would have to lose someone to silence the way you lost her."

This was the approach they'd planned. Not accusation. Understanding. Mirror Raymond's own rationalization back to him, show that Jack could see the internal logic of his delusion. Make him feel heard.

"The first recording you made after Margaret—Thomas Hendricks, 1963. He threatened to report the station. You killed him to protect your ability to broadcast. To keep Margaret's voice alive on the airwaves. Was that when you discovered it? That recording someone at the moment of death captured something... more?"

Jack's hands were steady on the desk, but his heart hammered. He was speaking to a serial killer. A man who'd murdered thirty-two people. Who'd invited them here to add their voices to his collection. But fear wouldn't help. He needed to stay in his DJ persona. Calm. Curious. A voice in the dark asking questions.

"I read your notes about 'authentic emotional resonance,'" Jack said. "How voices recorded under extreme emotion—fear, pleading, final moments—had a quality that regular recordings lacked. You started selecting victims based on that. Looking for people with beautiful voices who were lonely enough to visit, isolated enough that they wouldn't be missed."

Through the window, Marie held up five fingers. Five minutes down. Seven remaining.

"Here's what I can't figure out, Raymond. You're brilliant. Your technical knowledge, your psychological understanding of loneliness, your ability to evade authorities for twenty years—you're one of the smartest people I've ever studied. So you must know that what you're doing isn't preservation. It's imprisonment."

Jack leaned closer to the microphone, the way he did when making a point to his college audience.

"Margaret loved you. I saw her photograph, read what you wrote about her. She sounds like she was kind, warm, genuine. Do you think she'd want her voice used as justification for murder? Do you think she'd want you to spend twenty years killing people in her name?"

He let that question hang. Then shifted.

"The people you recorded—Jennifer Holcomb, David Monroe, Thomas Hendricks, all of them—they had families. People who loved them. When you broadcast their voices after death, those families heard them. Thought they were still alive. Some filed complaints with the FCC. Did you know that? Families heard their dead loved ones requesting songs on your show. Can you imagine what that did to them? The hope, then the confusion, then the horror of realizing it was a recording?"

Jack's voice stayed gentle, but he pushed harder.

"You see yourself as saving people from oblivion. But Raymond, you're not saving anyone. You're stealing their final moments, their last words, and forcing them to transmit forever. They didn't consent. They didn't choose radio immortality. You chose for them."

Marie held up two fingers. Two minutes to the next programmed song.

"I understand parasocial relationships," Jack said. "I'm a DJ. I have listeners who feel like they know me because they hear my voice five nights a week. Some write letters, tell me personal things, trust me with their loneliness. That's the power of radio—it creates intimacy without proximity. You feel connected to a voice in the dark."

He paused, then drove the point home.

"But that intimacy isn't real, Raymond. The listeners don't actually know me. I don't actually know them. It's an illusion. A beautiful illusion, maybe, but still an illusion. And you've confused that illusion with reality. The people who called your show, who told you they were lonely—they didn't love you. They loved the voice. The persona. The Night Caller character you created. They didn't know Raymond Peck."

One minute.

"That's what this is really about, isn't it?" Jack's voice dropped lower, more intimate. "Not Margaret. Not radio immortality. Loneliness. You're lonely, Raymond. The station is isolated. You live alone. The only people you interact with are the ones you lure here to record. And after you kill them, you play their voices at night to keep yourself company. You've built a broadcast full of dead people because you can't connect with living ones."

Jack swallowed. This was the risk. Pushing too hard might make Raymond run, or attack, or shut down completely. But if he could get through...

"You don't have to keep doing this," Jack said. "The killing. The recordings. You could stop. You could turn yourself in. Help us identify all the victims, give families closure. What you've done is—it's monstrous, Raymond. I won't pretend otherwise. But you're still a person. You can still make different choices."

The song rotation ticked over. Buddy Holly, "True Love Ways." 2:28. Shorter than Jack wanted, but enough to finish.

"We're not leaving," Jack said. "We're not running. We have evidence—journals, tapes, photographs, everything. Authorities will come eventually. This compound will be excavated. Your tape collection will be seized. The broadcasts will end. Radio immortality will be revealed as the delusion it always was."

He took a breath.

"So here's my question, Raymond. When they come—when this is over—do you want to be remembered as The Night Caller, the voice that brought comfort to lonely people across three states? Or do you want to be remembered as the monster who betrayed that trust? Because right now, you get to choose. Turn yourself in. Help us. There's no redemption for thirty-two murders, but there's... something. Acknowledgment. Truth. Closure for families."

The song played underneath. Buddy Holly's earnest voice singing about true love lasting.

"Or you can keep hiding," Jack said quietly. "Keep planning. Come back here and try to add our voices to your collection. But Raymond—we know you're coming. We're ready. And when this is over, one way or another, everyone will know what you've done. The Night Caller will be exposed. Your immortality project will be destroyed. Voices will be silent again."

He paused one final time.

"The question is: do you want to destroy them yourself by turning yourself in, or do you want authorities to destroy them when they raid this compound? Either way, the broadcasts end. But only one way gives you any control over how you're remembered."

Jack closed the microphone. Buddy Holly sang on. Through the window, the others stared at him. Paulie had stopped working. Marie's pen hung motionless. Leon gripped the window frame. Shelly's eyes were wide.

Had it worked? Had he gotten through? Or had he just provoked a serial killer into accelerating his timeline?

The broadcast continued its automated routine. Song after song, interspersed with Raymond's pre-recorded voice making gentle comments about the weather, the lateness of the hour, the loneliness of nights in October. No response. No acknowledgment. Just the programming continuing as if Jack had never spoken.

But somewhere in the dark mountains, Raymond Peck was listening. Processing. Deciding.

Jack pulled off the headphones. His hands were shaking now that it was over. He'd spent twelve minutes trying to reach the humanity in a man who'd spent twenty years murdering people. Twelve minutes of psychological warfare, using the same techniques Raymond used—vocal intimacy, parasocial connection, the illusion of understanding.

Would it work? Or had he just made everything worse?

Marie entered the booth. "That was..." She didn't finish. Couldn't find the word.

"Either really smart or really stupid," Jack said.

"Both," Paulie said from the doorway. "Definitely both."

Leon appeared behind him. "You told a serial killer to turn himself in. On his own radio station. Using his own manipulation techniques against him."

"Yeah."

"That's crazy."

"Yeah."

Shelly spoke from the equipment room. "It was brave."

Jack met her eyes through the window. She looked different. Harder. Like something had crystallized in her during his broadcast. The parasocial relationship she'd had with The Night Caller—the one-sided love she'd felt for Raymond's voice—she understood now what it really was. Illusion. Loneliness misrecognized as connection.

"Now what?" Marie asked.

"Now we wait," Jack said. "See if he responds."

They waited through the night. The broadcast continued, pre-programmed perfection. No interruptions. No Raymond. Just the warm voice of The Night Caller playing requests from dead people, keeping lonely listeners company across three states.

At dawn, they were exhausted. But something had changed. Jack could feel it. By speaking directly to Raymond, by naming what he was doing and offering a choice, they'd shifted the dynamic. They weren't just prey anymore. They were active opponents. Psychological combatants using radio as their battlefield.

Outside, fog clung to the mountains. The transmission tower rose into gray sky, broadcasting Raymond's voice to the world. But for the first time since arriving, Jack felt like they had power. The microphone was a weapon. And he knew how to use it.

Whether that would be enough to survive remained to be seen.
