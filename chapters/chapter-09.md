# Chapter 9: The Sound of Hidden Spaces

Paulie had spent years training his ears. Sound engineering was about understanding how audio behaved in physical space. How rooms shaped sound. How walls reflected it. How empty spaces resonated.

The station building was lying to him.

He stood in the equipment room, clapping his hands rhythmically, listening to the echoes. Each clap produced a pattern of reflections: initial sound, near wall reflection, far wall reflection, complex interferences creating the room's acoustic signature.

Professional habit from dozens of studios and concert halls.

But this room sounded wrong.

"What are you doing?" Jack asked, watching from the doorway.

"Acoustic mapping." Paulie clapped again, tilting his head. "Every enclosed space has a characteristic reverb pattern. Function of dimensions, materials, absorption. I'm measuring this room."

"And?"

"And it doesn't match what I'm seeing." He paced to the far wall, knocked on it. Solid concrete. Knocked again three feet left. Different sound—hollow behind the wall covering.

Leon and Marie joined them. Shelly remained outside, visible through the window, still refusing to participate.

"Show me," Marie said.

Paulie demonstrated, clapping in different locations, showing how the echo pattern shifted. "Here, near the center—reverb pattern suggests the room extends another eight to ten feet beyond that wall. But the wall appears to be the building's exterior."

"So there's space behind it," Leon said.

"Or below it." Paulie knelt, tapping the floor. Solid. Moved three feet. Still solid. Three more feet. Hollow. "There. Hear that?"

They all knocked, heard the difference.

"Could be a crawlspace," Marie suggested. "Plumbing access."

"For an above-ground building?" Paulie shook his head. "That's not standard construction. And the acoustic space I'm hearing is bigger than a crawlspace."

He continued mapping, moving methodically across the room, clapping and listening. His mental image of the space grew clearer: equipment room on the ground floor, dimensions roughly thirty by twenty feet. But the acoustic signature suggested additional volume—like an empty chamber adjoining or beneath.

"There," he said finally, pointing to the back corner. "Strongest resonance from that area. Either there's a void behind that wall or below this section of floor."

They examined the wall. Painted cinderblock, same as the rest. No obvious seams, doors, or access panels. But Paulie had learned to look beyond the obvious.

He traced the mortar lines between blocks, looking for inconsistencies. Found one: a vertical section where the mortar was slightly different color, newer. Someone had removed and replaced blocks here, trying to hide it.

"Help me move this shelf," he said.

The shelf held equipment manuals and spare parts. They cleared it, Jack and Leon helping, then slid the heavy industrial shelf aside.

Behind it: a wall panel. Wood, painted to match the cinderblock but actually covering something. Paulie ran his fingers along the edge, found a seam, pulled.

The panel swung away, revealing a ventilation shaft.

"Jesus," Jack breathed.

The shaft was maybe three feet square, large enough for a person to fit through, angling downward into darkness. Metal sides, smooth from use. A ladder of sorts—metal rungs welded to one wall at regular intervals.

Paulie shone his flashlight down. The beam disappeared into depth, revealing only the first ten feet of descent before the shaft turned horizontal.

"That goes beneath the building," he said. "Definitely not standard ventilation."

"Hidden access to a basement," Marie said, already pulling out her camera.

"A soundproofed basement," Paulie added. "Look at the shaft walls. That's acoustic damping material. Commercial grade, designed to block sound transmission."

Why would you soundproof a ventilation shaft? Paulie knew the answer but didn't want to say it aloud: so people inside couldn't be heard from outside.

So screams wouldn't carry.

"Someone needs to go down," Leon said.

They looked at each other. The shaft was narrow, dark, and led to God knew what. Every survival instinct said stay out.

But they needed to know.

"I'll go," Leon volunteered. "I'm smallest."

"You sure?" Jack asked.

"No. But I'll do it anyway." Leon took the flashlight, tested the rungs. Solid. He climbed in, feet-first, descending carefully.

Paulie watched him disappear into the shaft, heard the scrape of clothing against metal, the clang of boots on rungs. Leon's voice echoed strangely—the acoustic damping affecting frequencies oddly.

"First section is about ten feet down," Leon called up. "Then it goes horizontal. Crawlspace height."

"Can you continue?" Marie asked.

"Yeah. Going."

They listened to Leon's progress—shuffling sounds, occasional grunts, the flashlight beam visible as a dim glow that receded. Paulie counted seconds. Thirty. Sixty. Ninety.

"Leon?" Jack called. "You okay?"

"Still here. Horizontal shaft is maybe twenty feet. There's another drop ahead. Steeper. Looks like it goes into a room."

"Describe it," Marie said, camera ready.

"Metal ladder. Bolted to shaft wall. Drops maybe another ten feet. I can see... light down there. Dim light. Something's powered on."

Paulie's pulse quickened. Powered equipment meant active use. Raymond's hidden workspace.

"I'm going down," Leon said.

They listened. Metal sounds, Leon's breathing amplified by the shaft. Then silence.

Then Leon's voice, distant and strange: "Oh my God."

"What?" Jack called. "What do you see?"

No response for long seconds. Then: "You need to see this. All of you."

Paulie looked at Jack and Marie. Unspoken agreement passed between them.

"I'm coming down," Jack said, climbing into the shaft.

Paulie followed. The metal rungs were cold under his hands. As he descended, the acoustic environment changed—damping material absorbing sound, making everything feel deadened, muffled. His ears registered the change, trained to notice such things.

The vertical shaft dropped ten feet, then transitioned to horizontal. Paulie had to crawl, flashlight between his teeth, the confined space pressing close. Ahead, Jack's legs disappearing around a corner.

The second drop was steeper, almost a straight vertical descent. Paulie took it slowly, boots finding each rung, flashlight swinging. Cool air rose from below—not cold exactly, but climate-controlled. Regulated.

Fifteen feet down, the shaft opened into a room.

Paulie dropped the last few feet, landing on concrete floor, and looked up.

"Oh my God," he echoed Leon.

They stood in a long, narrow room carved from bedrock. The walls were natural stone, rough and unfinished except where someone had bolted equipment racks and mounted acoustic foam. Fluorescent lights ran the ceiling length, currently dim but functional. The space was maybe forty feet long, ten feet wide, seven feet high.

And the walls were lined with reel-to-reel tapes.

Hundreds of them. Maybe thousands. Industrial shelving floor to ceiling on both long walls, each shelf packed with tape reels in their boxes. Each box labeled in careful handwriting.

Paulie approached slowly, reading labels.

"Margaret Peck, 1961."

"Thomas Hendricks, 1963."

"Angela Martinez, 1971."

"Jennifer Holcomb, 1978."

Names and dates. Victim after victim. Paulie kept reading, moving down the shelf, the dates progressing. Each tape labeled with a name and the year of death.

"There must be fifty," Jack said, voice hollow.

Leon was counting. "More. I see at least eighty on this side alone."

Paulie reached the end of the first shelf. The most recent tape: "David Monroe, September 1982."

Last month. The latest victim.

At the room's center: a work area. Desk with tape deck, mixing equipment, editing tools. Microphone on a boom arm. Headphones. Everything needed to record, edit, and process audio.

And a chair. Heavy, solid, with restraints on the arms.

"Oh God," Marie said, emerging from the shaft behind them. She'd brought her camera. Started photographing immediately, documenting everything.

Paulie examined the recording equipment. Professional grade, meticulously maintained. The desk held notes in Raymond's handwriting: recording schedules, editing instructions, broadcast timings.

One note, recent ink: "New voices arriving Friday. Five subjects. Prepare equipment."

Friday. Two days ago. When they'd arrived.

"We were scheduled," Leon said, reading over Paulie's shoulder. "Five subjects. Us. He planned this."

Jack found another document: the contest entries. All five of their applications, annotated with Raymond's analysis.

"Jack Sullivan—pleasant voice, radio experience, good emotional range."

"Marie Torres—intellectual, precise diction, skeptical tone valuable."

"Paulie Rizzo—technical knowledge, calm delivery, useful expertise."

"Leon Kowalski—conspiracy theorist, paranoid edge, interesting perspective."

"Shelly Vaughn—devoted fan, emotional vulnerability, beautiful timbre."

They'd been evaluated. Judged for vocal quality. Selected for harvest.

Paulie felt sick. This wasn't about murder for murder's sake. This was about collection. Raymond gathered voices like someone might collect stamps or coins. Preserved them. Catalogued them. Used them in his broadcast forever.

Audio immortality. Voices that never died.

"Look at this," Marie said.

She'd found Raymond's master log: every victim listed chronologically with dates and brief notes.

"Margaret Peck, 1961 - Wife. Car accident. Only one recording saved. Why I started preserving others."

"Thomas Hendricks, 1963 - First intentional preservation. Discovered the technique. Perfect voice, warm, genuine. Still broadcasts regularly."

"Angela Martinez, 1971 - Reluctant at first. Eight hours of recording before quieting. Beautiful soprano range."

The entries continued, clinical and affectionate simultaneously. Raymond wrote about his victims like prized possessions. Treasured items in a collection.

"We need to get out," Jack said. "Document this and get out immediately."

Marie was already photographing—shelves, tapes, equipment, Raymond's notes. Evidence of systematic murder spanning twenty years.

Paulie examined the recording setup more closely. Professional multitrack recorder, editing suite, acoustic treatment. Everything needed to capture perfect audio.

And scratches on the chair arms. Deep gouges where fingernails had dug in. Struggling.

He thought about how it must have worked: Raymond inviting victims up, making them comfortable, engaging them in conversation while recording. Hours of voice samples—laughing, talking, requesting songs. Building a library of sounds.

And then, when he had enough, when the recordings were complete...

Paulie didn't want to finish the thought.

"There's more," Leon called from the far end of the room. "Another door."

Paulie joined him. A heavy metal door, closed, with a small window at eye level. Leon shone his flashlight through.

"Storage," he said. "More shelves. And—"

He stopped, face going pale.

"What?" Paulie asked.

Leon stepped back, letting Paulie look.

Through the window: a secondary room, smaller, with metal shelving. On the shelves: plastic containers, carefully labeled.

Personal effects. Wallets, watches, jewelry. Items tagged with victim names and dates.

Trophies. Raymond kept trophies.

And in the back, visible in the flashlight beam: a freezer. Industrial size.

Paulie didn't want to know what was in the freezer.

"We're leaving," he said. "Now. Document what we can in five minutes, then we climb out and we run."

"Run where?" Marie asked. "Van's disabled. Phone's cut. We're twenty-three miles from help."

"Then we walk. Now. Before Raymond comes back."

Because if Raymond returned and found them here, in his collection room, among his preserved voices, Paulie knew exactly what would happen.

They'd become tapes on the shelf.

Labeled and catalogued.

Broadcasting forever.
