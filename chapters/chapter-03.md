# Chapter 3: Night Broadcast

Jack gave up on sleep around eleven-thirty.

He'd been lying on his bunk for an hour, listening to the broadcast drift through the thin bunkhouse walls. Raymond's voice, song after song, the occasional caller requesting something classic. Shelly had fallen asleep with a small smile, one hand tucked under her cheek. Leon lay with his eyes open, staring at the ceiling. Marie and Paulie were both awake, restless.

"Anyone else want to see inside?" Paulie whispered.

Jack sat up. "Yeah."

Marie was already pulling on her jacket.

They left Shelly sleeping and Leon keeping watch. Outside, the October night was cold enough to see their breath. The compound sat in darkness except for the blinking tower lights and a faint glow from the main building.

"There." Paulie pointed to a window on the side of the building, slightly open. "Saw it earlier."

They reached it quickly. The window opened onto what looked like a small office or storage room. Paulie went first, hoisting himself through with surprising ease for a stocky guy. Marie next, then Jack, who scraped his shoulder on the frame and bit back a curse.

Inside, the air smelled different. Electronics and cigarette smoke and something else—old vinyl records, maybe, or aged paper. They stood in a narrow room lined with filing cabinets and shelves holding equipment manuals. A doorway led deeper into the building.

Through that doorway: the station proper.

Jack stopped, taking it in.

The interior was pristine 1962. Wood paneling covered every wall, dark and rich. Vinyl furniture in avocado green—couch, chairs, coffee table with old magazines. Linoleum tile floor in cream and brown squares. Everything clean, maintained, untouched by decades.

"It's like a time capsule," Marie breathed, already raising her camera.

Paulie moved toward the equipment. One wall held rack-mounted gear: amplifiers, signal processors, switching equipment. Everything professional-grade, meticulously cared for. Lights glowed on the panels—green, amber, red—indicating active systems. Cables ran in neat bundles, labeled with tags in careful handwriting.

And from speakers mounted in the ceiling, Raymond's voice: "That was Patsy Cline with 'Crazy.' Beautiful song. Never gets old. Coming up on midnight now, friends. If you're still with me, I appreciate the company."

"Where's it coming from?" Jack whispered.

Paulie pointed up.

A staircase led to the second floor. They climbed it, footsteps quiet on the metal treads. At the top: the broadcast booth.

It was elevated, overlooking the equipment room through a wall of windows. Inside the booth: a control board with rows of switches and faders, two turntables, two reel-to-reel tape decks, a microphone on a boom arm, padded walls covered in acoustic foam, and a chair.

An empty chair.

The broadcast was running—Jack could see it happening. One tape deck playing, reels slowly turning. A record spinning on the left turntable. Levels dancing on VU meters. But no one sitting at the controls. No one touching the equipment.

"Jesus," Jack whispered.

Marie's camera clicked rapidly.

Paulie opened the booth door and stepped inside. Jack followed, Marie right behind. Up close, the equipment was even more impressive. The mixing board was custom-built, components soldered by hand, modifications everywhere. Someone—Raymond, presumably—had spent decades perfecting this setup.

"Look at this." Paulie pointed to a panel covered in switches, each labeled with times. "Automation system. Timers trigger tape playback, record changes, even the microphone." He traced the wiring. "Sophisticated for the era. This is NASA-level engineering for a pirate station."

"But can it handle live callers?" Marie asked.

"Depends. Pre-recorded calls on tape, triggered at the right times? Sure. Actual live phone interaction? No way."

As if responding to the challenge, Raymond's voice came through the speakers: "Let's take another call. Hello, caller. You're on The Night Caller."

A pause. Then a woman's voice, thin through the phone line: "Hi, Raymond. This is Jenny from Bristol."

"Jenny! Good to hear from you. How are you tonight?"

"I'm doing well. A little lonely, but your show helps."

"That's what I'm here for, Jenny. What can I play for you?"

"How about 'Stand By Me'? That's my favorite."

"Coming right up. 'Stand By Me' for Jenny in Bristol. Stay warm out there."

The call ended. Music started: Ben E. King's voice filling the booth.

Jack looked at Paulie. "That sounded live."

"Did it?" Paulie rewound one of the tape decks slightly, listening on headphones. He stopped, his expression changing. "It's tape. Listen."

He held the headphones so Jack and Marie could hear. The conversation played again: Raymond greeting Jenny, Jenny's request. But this time Jack heard it—a tiny discontinuity, a fraction of a second where the audio jumped. The splice.

"It's edited," Paulie said quietly. "Recorded conversation, spliced to sound like real-time. Raymond's questions on one tape, Jenny's answers on another, mixed live by the automation system to simulate a phone call."

"Why?" Marie asked.

"To maintain the illusion," Jack said. "The intimacy. People call in, share their loneliness, make requests. That's the whole appeal of The Night Caller. Raymond makes you feel heard."

"But if the calls aren't real..."

"Then what is?"

They stood in the empty booth, watching the equipment work. Tape deck stopping, another starting. The needle lifting from one record, settling onto another. Switches flipping themselves through the automation system, small servo motors clicking. A perfectly choreographed performance with no performer.

"There has to be someone here," Marie insisted. "Monitoring, making adjustments, maintaining this."

Leon's voice crackled from a walkie-talkie on the console. Jack hadn't noticed it before. "You guys in the station?"

Paulie picked it up. "Yeah. You see us?"

"No. But I heard the window open. Listen, something weird just happened."

"What?"

"Raymond mentioned the weather. Said it's getting cold tonight, might see frost. And—" Leon paused. "That's accurate. I checked the thermometer outside the bunkhouse. Thirty-four degrees. How does he know?"

Jack felt the hair on his neck rise. "Automated weather station? Sensor feeding data to the system?"

Paulie was already looking, tracing wires to a small unit mounted near the window. "Yeah. Temperature sensor, barometric pressure. Feeds into the automation. Raymond—or whoever programmed this—set it to insert weather comments based on current conditions."

"That's insane," Marie said. "The level of planning..."

"Twenty years," Paulie said. "Twenty years to perfect this system."

They explored further. The equipment room on the first floor held more wonders: a library of vinyl records, thousands of them, alphabetized and cross-referenced with a card catalog. Reel-to-reel tapes stacked on industrial shelving, each labeled with content and duration. A workshop area with soldering equipment, spare tubes and transistors, repair manuals.

Everything organized. Everything maintained. Everything running exactly as designed.

In a small room off the main space, they found a desk with logs. Broadcasting schedules, handwritten, dating back years. Maintenance records documenting every repair, every upgrade, every adjustment. And listener letters—hundreds of them, filed by date, many with annotations in the margins.

Jack picked up one at random. Dated 1979, from someone named Thomas in Asheville. Thanking Raymond for the company during long nights. Saying how much the show meant. Raymond had written in the margin: "Beautiful voice. Lonely. Possible."

Possible what?

Marie was photographing the logs when Paulie called them back upstairs.

In the booth, he pointed at the automation system's master clock. "Look at the schedule."

They looked. A detailed timeline, hour by hour: 10:00 PM—Opening. 10:15—First caller (Jenny). 10:30—Second caller (Thomas). 11:00—Weather comment. Midnight—Station ID. On and on through the night.

"It's all planned," Paulie said. "Every call, every song, every comment. Scheduled weeks in advance."

"Then where's Raymond?" Jack asked.

No answer. Just the broadcast continuing, Raymond's voice warm and constant: "You're listening to The Night Caller. I'll be with you until sunrise."

They watched through the night, taking turns. Paulie monitored the equipment, fascinated by its complexity. Marie documented everything with her camera and notebook. Jack just listened, trying to reconcile the voice he'd loved with the empty booth, the automated performance.

Around three AM, Leon joined them, leaving Shelly asleep. He brought his own notebooks, started cross-referencing the broadcast with his logs from previous shows.

"The calls repeat," he confirmed. "Jenny requesting 'Stand By Me'—I've logged that six times. Thomas asking for 'Blue Moon'—four times. Same voices, same conversations, different nights."

"How far back?" Marie asked.

Leon flipped through pages. "Years. Some of these callers—I've been hearing them since I started listening in 1979."

"That's impossible," Jack said. "People don't call in with the same request for three years."

"Exactly."

They fell silent, watching the equipment. The broadcast rolled on, tireless. Songs blending into songs, Raymond's voice between them, smooth as silk. The sky outside stayed dark, but Jack's internal clock told him dawn was coming.

At 5:45 AM, the broadcast shifted. Raymond's voice: "Well, friends, we're coming to the end of another night together. Thanks for keeping me company. Remember, you're never really alone—there's always someone out there listening, feeling what you feel. Until next time, this is The Night Caller, signing off."

A final song: "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong.

At exactly 6:00 AM, the music ended. The equipment powered down—not all at once, but in sequence. Tape decks stopping, turntables returning arms to rest, lights dimming on the panels. Within thirty seconds, silence.

Complete silence.

The four of them stood in the booth, exhausted, surrounded by dormant equipment. Outside, the sky was lightening, gray dawn filtering through the windows. The compound looked different in that early light—smaller, less ominous, just a collection of buildings on a mountaintop.

But also more mysterious. Because now they knew: The Night Caller broadcast itself. Raymond's voice played from tapes. The callers weren't real. The intimacy was illusion, automation masquerading as human connection.

"I don't understand," Jack said finally. "Why build all this? Why maintain it for twenty years? Why create something so elaborate just to fake a radio show?"

"Maybe it wasn't supposed to be fake," Marie said quietly. "Maybe it started real, and this—" she gestured at the equipment "—is what it became."

Paulie was staring at the automation system, tracing its complexity. "Someone programmed this. Someone maintains it. Someone loads the tapes and records, keeps everything running. That's not automatic—that's manual labor."

"So where is he?" Leon asked again.

They had no answer. Just the silent equipment and the brightening sky and the profound unease of having watched an empty room perform for eight hours.

Jack looked out the window at the bunkhouse, where Shelly still slept, dreaming of meeting Raymond. He thought about the voice on the tapes, the warm intimacy, the promise of connection that had drawn them all here.

And he wondered what they'd actually found.
