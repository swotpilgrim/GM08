# Chapter 11: The Death Dates

Marie had been training for this her entire academic career. Document everything. Maintain objectivity. Let evidence speak.

But evidence was screaming, and objectivity felt impossible.

She stood in Raymond's basement studio, camera in shaking hands, photographing a serial killer's archive. Two years of graduate research on pirate radio had led her here—to a murder scene preserved like a museum exhibit.

Fifty-three victims. Twenty years. All documented with meticulous care.

Focus, she told herself. Document first. Process later.

She started with the tape library, photographing each shelf systematically. Click. Advance film. Click. Each photograph captured multiple tape boxes, labels visible. Evidence that couldn't be disputed.

Margaret Peck, 1961.
Thomas Hendricks, 1963.
Robert Shaw, 1965.
Sarah Williams, 1969.
Angela Martinez, 1971.

The dates told a story. Marie pulled out her notebook, creating a timeline as she photographed. Trying to see the pattern Raymond had followed.

"Leon," she called. "Help me with dates."

He joined her, notebook ready. They worked systematically—Marie reading labels, Leon recording them, both noting any details.

The pattern emerged quickly.

"First cluster," Leon said. "1963 to 1965. Four victims in three years."

"Then a gap," Marie noted. "Nothing in 1966 or 1967."

"Resumes 1969. Sarah Williams."

They continued. Murders weren't consistent—sometimes one per year, sometimes three. But clusters appeared, primarily in fall and winter months.

"October through February," Marie said. "Look. Eighty percent of victims died in that five-month window."

"Seasonal," Leon muttered, writing. "Why seasonal?"

Marie thought about it. "Isolation maybe. Easier to lure victims in cold weather? Offer of warmth, companionship. Or broadcasting schedule—more listeners during long winter nights."

The academic part of her brain kept working, analyzing patterns, while the human part recoiled. She was profiling a serial killer's methodology like it was a thesis topic.

But that's what it was now. Dark research. Evidence collection.

She moved to Raymond's desk, photographing everything. The workspace was immaculate—pencils aligned, papers stacked, equipment maintained. A professional broadcaster's setup.

And a killer's planning station.

The desk held multiple documents:

**Broadcast schedules**: Detailed spreadsheets showing which "callers" aired when. Marie photographed them, saw the system. Each victim's voice scheduled into regular rotation. Thomas Hendricks every Tuesday at 11:15 PM requesting "Blue Moon." Jennifer Holcomb every Friday at 10:23 PM requesting "Stand By Me."

Automated intimacy. Scripted connection.

**Victim selection notes**: Handwritten analysis of potential targets. Marie's stomach turned reading them.

"Jennifer Holcomb - Age 26, works night shift at diner, estranged from family. Beautiful voice, soprano range. Calls in regularly, always alone. Isolated. Perfect candidate."

"Michael Chen - Age 29, college dropout, lives alone in apartment, calls frequently expressing loneliness. Distinctive voice, technical vocabulary, works in electronics shop. No close friends. Excellent choice."

"David Monroe - Age 30, bookstore clerk, recent breakup, seeking connection through radio. Warm baritone, expressive range. Lives alone. Family in another state. Ideal subject."

Reading them felt like violation. Raymond studied his victims like specimens. Identified vulnerability, isolation, vocal characteristics. Selected for quality and lack of connections—people who wouldn't be immediately missed.

Professional predator with a collector's eye.

**Burial maps**: Hand-drawn diagrams showing locations around the compound. Marie photographed them carefully. Fifty-three marked graves, each with corresponding name and date.

Evidence for recovery teams. Bodies that families could finally lay to rest.

She found another document: **Audio preservation notes**. Raymond's technical documentation of his process. Written like a lab protocol.

"Subject should be comfortable initially. Natural conversation produces best vocal samples. Record minimum 4-6 hours before revelation. Capture full emotional range: joy, sadness, fear, anger, pleading. Editing requires variety. Test equipment beforehand—cannot afford technical failures during preservation."

Clinical. Methodical. Monstrous.

"Sedation timing critical: too early and voice becomes slurred (unusable), too late and subject becomes uncooperative. Optimal window 2-3 hours into recording session. Dosage varies by body weight and tolerance. Keep subject alert enough for clear speech but compliant."

"Post-preservation: catalog immediately, test playback quality, integrate into broadcast schedule within two weeks. Fresh voices generate listener interest. Archive original recordings in climate-controlled storage. Make working copies for editing. Never use original tapes for broadcast—preserve masters."

Marie had to stop, put the camera down, breathe. This wasn't research. This was horror made systematic. Raymond had refined his technique over twenty years, perfecting murder like someone might perfect a recipe.

Jack appeared beside her. "You okay?"

"No. But I'll keep going." She picked up the camera again. "We need everything. Every piece of evidence."

She photographed the technical notes, the schedules, the selection criteria. Building a case file that would convict Raymond posthumously—if he wasn't caught alive.

In the desk drawer: polaroids.

Marie's hands shook as she pulled them out. Dozens of photos, organized chronologically.

Each victim photographed twice.

First photo: alive, smiling, standing with Raymond at the station. Looking excited, honored, happy. Visitors to The Night Caller, meeting their radio hero.

Second photo: dead, buried, grave marker visible.

Before and after.

Jennifer Holcomb smiling beside Raymond, her feathered blonde hair catching sunlight. Jennifer Holcomb in the ground, marker reading "Jenny, 1978 - Beautiful Forever."

Michael Chen laughing, holding headphones in the broadcast booth. Michael Chen's grave, marker reading "Michael, 1975 - Voice Preserved."

David Monroe, the most recent, looking nervous but excited. David Monroe's fresh grave, dirt still dark, marker reading "David, 9/82 - Eternal Broadcast."

Fifty-three victims. One hundred and six polaroids. Complete documentation of Raymond's collection.

Marie photographed every single one, tears blurring her vision but hands steady. This was evidence. This would convict him.

At the far end of the desk, separate from the others: a glass case.

Inside: a single tape reel, labeled in careful script.

**Margaret Peck, 1961.**

Marie photographed it through the glass, then looked for information about Margaret. Found it in a leather journal, Raymond's personal writing.

"September 12, 1961. Lost Margaret today. Car accident on Route 23. Died instantly, they said. Painless.

But the pain is mine. The silence is unbearable. I have one recording—her laugh from our anniversary dinner, captured on the tape recorder I gave her. Five seconds of her voice. It's all I have left.

I've played it two hundred times today. The tape is wearing. Soon it will deteriorate, and even that small piece of her will be gone. Erased. Silent.

I can't let that happen. I won't let silence take her completely.

There must be a way to preserve voices forever. To capture them before death, store them perfectly, replay them endlessly. Technology for immortality.

Margaret is gone. But her voice can remain. Must remain.

I'll find a way. I'll preserve others. Everyone deserves to be remembered. Everyone deserves to escape silence.

This station will be my monument. To Margaret. To preservation. To voices that refuse to die."

Marie read it twice, trying to understand the psychology. Grief transforming into obsession. Loss becoming murder. Love twisted into something monstrous.

Raymond started with tragedy—losing his wife. But he'd turned tragedy into system, preservation into predation.

She photographed the journal entry, the glass case, everything.

Leon called from the storage room. "Marie. There's more."

She joined him. The secondary room held additional evidence: plastic containers of personal effects. Wallets, watches, jewelry, each tagged with victim name and date.

Trophies. Kept separate from the voices, but still collected.

And at the back: the industrial freezer.

"Should we?" Leon asked.

Marie didn't want to. Wanted to pretend the freezer was for legitimate purposes. Food storage. Equipment cooling.

But she knew better.

"We document everything," she said.

Leon opened it.

Inside: biological samples. Labeled jars containing tissue, blood, hair. Each jar tagged with victim name.

"Why?" Leon whispered. "Why keep this?"

Marie thought about the preservation obsession. "Complete collection. Voice isn't enough. He wanted every part. Physical evidence they existed."

More photographs. More evidence. Building a case so comprehensive that no jury could doubt, no defense could argue.

They worked for another twenty minutes, documenting everything in the basement. Marie's camera was almost out of film—she'd brought four rolls, not expecting to need them all. Three were full now, the fourth nearly done.

Enough. They had enough.

"We're leaving," she announced. "Back up, pack our things, start hiking."

They climbed out of the basement, emerging into the equipment room. Afternoon light through windows seemed harsh after the basement's fluorescents.

The others were waiting—Jack and Paulie comparing notes, Shelly sitting quietly, no longer defensive.

"Got it all?" Jack asked.

"Everything," Marie said. "Fifty-three victims, twenty years, complete documentation. When we reach authorities, they'll have everything they need."

"If we reach them," Paulie said quietly.

"We will." Marie's academic training kicked in. "Twenty-three miles, moderate terrain, six to seven hours walking. We leave now, arrive by dark or shortly after."

"And if Raymond comes back?" Shelly asked.

"Then we move faster."

They gathered their things, checked supplies. Marie secured her camera carefully—those four rolls of film were the most important items they carried. Evidence that couldn't be replaced.

As they prepared to leave, Marie took one last look at the station. Two years of research had led here. She'd wanted to write about pirate radio, FCC enforcement, illegal broadcasting.

She'd found something far darker.

But she'd also found the truth. Documented it. Preserved it.

Raymond preserved voices. Marie would preserve justice.

They headed for the compound gate, afternoon sun slanting through fog, temperature dropping.

Twenty-three miles to safety.

To authorities who would listen.

To ending Raymond Peck's twenty-year collection.

Marie gripped her camera bag and started walking.
