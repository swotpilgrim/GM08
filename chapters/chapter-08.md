# Chapter 8: Theories and Denial

Dawn came gray and cold. Jack hadn't slept. He'd spent his watch shift staring at the dark compound, listening to wind and generator hum, thinking about voices preserved forever on tape.

Eight dead people. Broadcast nightly. Playing for lonely listeners who had no idea they were hearing victims.

The thought made him sick.

By seven AM they were all awake, crowded around the wood stove with instant coffee that tasted like bitter mud. No one had slept well. Leon's eyes were red-rimmed. Marie looked exhausted. Paulie kept checking the windows. Shelly sat apart, arms wrapped around herself, refusing to meet anyone's eyes.

"We need to talk about this," Jack said finally.

"About what?" Shelly's voice was sharp. "About how you've all decided Raymond is a serial killer based on paranoid conspiracy theories?"

"Based on evidence," Marie corrected quietly. "Eight confirmed dead voices on his broadcasts. FCC complaints from families. Statistical anomalies that—"

"Statistics are just numbers. You're interpreting them to fit a narrative."

"What's your interpretation?" Leon asked. "How do you explain eight dead people's voices on the show?"

"I don't know! Maybe Raymond saves recordings from regular callers. Maybe when they die, he plays them as tribute. Maybe it's coincidence. Maybe you're wrong about who the voices belong to."

"We're not wrong," Marie said. "I verified every obituary. Names, ages, locations, death dates. They match."

Shelly stood, pacing. "Okay. Fine. Say you're right—eight dead people. That doesn't mean Raymond killed them. People die naturally. Accidents, illness, whatever. Raymond records calls, those people happen to die later, he keeps using the recordings. Tragic but not criminal."

"Across twenty years?" Leon shook his head. "Mortality rates don't support that."

"I don't care about your statistics!"

"Then care about this." Paulie pulled out his audio analysis. "The recordings are professional quality. Studio acoustics. High-fidelity equipment. These aren't phone calls saved from broadcasts. These are purpose-recorded audio sessions."

"So Raymond invited fans to visit the station, recorded them talking, and used that for the show. People probably felt honored."

"And then they died," Jack said quietly. "Shortly after visiting."

"You don't know they visited. You're assuming."

But Jack was thinking about the contest, how they'd been invited, how the van had been sabotaged and the phone line cut. "We were invited. Five contest winners. And look at our situation—trapped, no way to leave, Raymond absent."

"He's delayed!" Shelly's voice rose. "An emergency. He'll be here."

"It's been over forty-eight hours since we arrived," Marie said. "That's not delay. That's abandonment. Or deliberate absence."

"Why? Why would Raymond deliberately avoid us?"

"Because," Leon said slowly, "he's not planning to meet us. He's planning to record us."

The bunkhouse fell silent.

Jack felt the words settle, cold and heavy. It made a horrible kind of sense. Invite dedicated listeners, isolate them, record hours of conversation through hidden microphones they'd already found, then—

Then what?

"You people are insane," Shelly said, but she sounded scared. "Raymond loves his listeners. His show is about connection, about making people feel less alone. He wouldn't hurt anyone."

"You don't know that," Marie said gently. "You've never met him. None of us have. We know the voice, the persona. But that's performance. Raymond Peck the person could be anyone."

"No." Shelly shook her head vigorously. "I've listened for years. You can't fake that kind of warmth, that empathy. I know Raymond. Maybe not face to face, but I know his heart."

Jack recognized the desperation in her voice. He'd felt something similar— that sense of connection to Raymond's broadcasts, the feeling that the voice understood him. But that was parasocial relationship, one-sided, imagined.

"Shelly," he said carefully, "people can fake empathy. Especially on radio. Voice control, pacing, the right words—it creates intimacy without actual connection."

"Like you would know," Shelly snapped. "You're a college DJ playing to empty rooms. Raymond reaches thousands."

The barb stung, but Jack pushed past it. "That's my point. I know how radio works. How to use your voice to create emotional response. It's technique, not genuine feeling."

"You're wrong."

"Maybe. But we can't ignore the evidence."

"What evidence? Coincidences! Circumstantial observations! Nothing proves Raymond hurt anyone."

"The FCC complaints—" Marie started.

"Dismissed!" Shelly interrupted. "By investigators who found nothing wrong. If Raymond was a killer, the FCC would've caught him."

"Unless he's too good at hiding," Leon said. "Signal bouncing, remote location, twenty years of careful evasion. Someone smart enough to fake live broadcasts for decades is smart enough to avoid detection."

"Or," Paulie added, "the FCC didn't look hard enough. Complaints about dead people's voices probably seemed too crazy to investigate thoroughly."

Shelly turned to Jack, eyes pleading. "You understand, right? You love the show too. You came here because you admire Raymond. Are you really ready to believe he's a monster based on Leon's paranoid theories?"

Jack thought about it honestly. Part of him still wanted Shelly to be right, wanted Raymond to be the warm voice, the companion through lonely nights. But another part—the rational part—couldn't ignore the pattern.

"I believe the evidence," he said finally. "Eight dead voices. Professional recordings. Hidden microphones. Sabotaged van. Cut phone line. It adds up to something wrong, even if I don't want it to."

Shelly's face crumpled. "Then you're all crazy. I'm not—I can't—"

She grabbed her jacket and headed for the door.

"Where are you going?" Marie asked.

"Away from you people. I'll wait for Raymond by myself. When he arrives and explains everything, you'll feel stupid."

"Shelly, we should stay together," Jack said.

"No. I'm done. Done with the conspiracy theories and the paranoia and the—" She stopped, tears streaking her carefully applied makeup. "Raymond's voice has gotten me through so much. Lonely nights, depression, feeling invisible. He made me feel seen. And you want me to believe he's evil. I can't. I won't."

She left, slamming the door.

They sat in uncomfortable silence. Jack felt guilty—they'd pushed too hard, cornered her emotionally. But what else could they do? Pretend the evidence didn't exist?

"She'll come around," Leon said, though he didn't sound convinced.

"Or she'll stay in denial until it's too late," Marie muttered. "We need to keep searching. Find more proof."

"Proof of what?" Jack asked. "We have dead voices and coincidental deaths. That's suspicious but not conclusive. We don't know how they died, where, or whether Raymond was involved."

"The station," Paulie said. "If Raymond records victims, he needs equipment. Recording studio, storage for tapes, probably soundproofing. Somewhere we haven't found yet."

"Hidden room?" Marie pulled out her station diagram. "I measured the building. Dimensions felt off but I couldn't pinpoint why."

Paulie compared her notes to his electrical map. "Power draw is higher than visible equipment accounts for. Could be heating or lighting for a hidden space."

"Basement," Leon suggested. "Underground is easier to soundproof. Hidden entrance, maybe through a maintenance access."

Jack stood, feeling purpose clarify. "Then we search. Systematically. Every wall, every floor, every panel. We find where Raymond keeps his recordings."

"And if we find them?" Marie asked.

"We document everything. Photograph it. Get evidence solid enough that authorities can't ignore it."

"And then we leave," Paulie added. "Hike out immediately, report to police."

They divided the search area: Marie took the main floor, using her architect's eye for spatial inconsistencies. Paulie focused on electrical and plumbing, tracing every wire and pipe. Leon examined the broadcast booth, looking for hidden access panels. Jack took the exterior, checking for hidden entrances, ventilation shafts, anything that might indicate underground space.

As they worked, Jack couldn't stop thinking about Shelly. She sat on the bunkhouse steps, visible through the window, staring at nothing. Defending Raymond because the alternative—that her comfort and connection had been lies—was too painful.

Jack understood. He'd felt the same pull, the desire to believe Raymond was good. But evidence didn't care about desires.

Mid-morning, Paulie called them to the equipment room.

"Found something," he said, pointing to the floor. "Acoustic inconsistency."

He stomped. The floor sounded normal—solid concrete. Then he moved three feet left and stomped again. Hollow. Definitely hollow.

Marie knelt, examining the floor joint. "This section is newer concrete. Different color, slightly different texture. Like it was patched or replaced."

"Or poured to cover something," Leon said.

They traced the hollow area—roughly eight by ten feet, located near the back corner of the equipment room. A trapdoor, maybe, or sealed entrance to a lower level.

"How do we access it?" Jack asked.

Paulie was already examining the walls, looking for mechanisms. "Hidden latch, probably. Pressure plate, false panel, something."

They searched for twenty minutes before Leon found it: a seemingly decorative wooden panel that slid aside, revealing a small electric switch.

"Should we?" Marie asked.

They looked at each other. Whatever was below, it was what Raymond wanted hidden. Evidence? Victims? Active recording equipment?

Jack thought about leaving, hiking out without knowing. Living with the questions forever. Or staying, finding answers, documenting the truth.

"We flip it," he decided. "But carefully. Together."

Paulie flipped the switch.

A mechanical sound: motors engaging, gears turning. Part of the concrete floor slid aside, revealing metal rungs descending into darkness.

A ladder. Leading down.

Into Raymond's hidden space.

Into the place where voices were recorded, preserved, and broadcast forever.

"Oh God," Marie whispered.

Jack stared into the darkness below, smelling old air and electronics and something else he couldn't identify.

They'd found it. Raymond's secret.

And now they had to decide whether to descend.
