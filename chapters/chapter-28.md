# Chapter 28: Aftermath and Evidence

Marie documented everything.

It was the only thing that helped. The only way to process what they'd survived. So she filled notebooks with details, organized evidence into systematic categories, created timelines that turned horror into data.

The FBI appreciated her thoroughness. The prosecutors even more so.

Week one: Excavation of the compound. Heavy equipment brought up the treacherous mountain road, crime scene teams working in October rain. Thirty-two graves around where the transmission tower had stood. Each marked with Raymond Peck's careful wooden markers. Names. Dates. "Forever Broadcasting."

Marie watched from a distance as they removed the first body. Thomas Hendricks, 1963. The skeleton was measured, photographed, documented. Dental records confirmed identity. His family in Asheville was notified after nineteen years of not knowing what happened.

She wrote it all down. Victim one: Thomas Hendricks, age 34, killed for threatening to report the pirate station. Buried 4.3 meters northeast of tower base.

The excavation took three weeks. Thirty-two bodies recovered. Some were mostly skeletal. Others more recent, like David Monroe from September, still recognizable. Each one was documented, identified through dental records or DNA. Families contacted.

Marie compiled the list:
- Thomas Hendricks, 1963
- Patricia Walsh, 1965
- Michael Chen, 1967
- And on. And on. Thirty-two names that had been missing persons cases, scattered across three states, never connected until now.

Week four: Evidence processing. The station building had burned to foundations, but the evidence boxes Marie and Shelly had carried out survived. Dozen tape reels. Raymond's journals. Victim selection notes. Broadcast schedules showing which dead voices played when.

Marie transcribed every journal entry. Catalogued every tape. Created a master spreadsheet linking victims to recordings to burial locations. The kind of systematic documentation that prosecutors loved and juries understood.

Raymond's methodology laid out in clinical detail:
1. Selection phase: Identify lonely callers through broadcast interactions
2. Invitation phase: Contest or special event invitation
3. Sedation phase: Drugged coffee, 30-45 minute delay
4. Recording phase: 8-12 hours of conversation while victim sedated/terrified
5. Termination phase: Suffocation or overdose
6. Burial phase: Marked grave near tower
7. Broadcast phase: Voice edited into ongoing programming

Twenty years of systematic murder. Meticulous. Documented. Refined over time.

Week six: Media coverage exploded. "The Night Caller Murders" dominated national news. True crime shows requested interviews. Families of victims spoke publicly for the first time in years.

Marie watched a mother on television describing how she'd heard her son's voice on the radio requesting songs five years after he'd disappeared. How she'd called the FCC to report it. How they'd dismissed her as grief-stricken, hearing things that weren't there.

But it had been real. Her son's voice, preserved in Raymond's tape library, broadcast posthumously. Comfort turned to horror.

Marie documented the media coverage too. Thirty-seven articles in major newspapers. Fourteen television segments. Three documentaries already in production. Raymond Peck's name entered the American serial killer lexicon alongside Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.

Week eight: FCC investigation. How had Raymond operated an illegal pirate station for twenty years without being caught?

The answer: sophisticated signal bouncing. Raymond had built relay equipment throughout the mountains, bouncing his broadcast signal between multiple transmission points. FCC triangulation efforts always led to empty hilltops or abandoned cabins, never the actual source.

It was brilliant, in its way. Raymond's technical knowledge was exceptional. He could have had a legitimate career in broadcast engineering. Instead, he'd used that knowledge to murder people and play their voices.

Marie included this in her thesis. Her communications graduate work had started as academic analysis of FCC regulation. Now it was a case study in regulatory failure. How a sophisticated killer exploited bureaucratic gaps to operate in plain sight for two decades.

Week ten: Testimony. Marie was called to give statements to FBI, local police, prosecutors, FCC investigators. Each agency wanted details. She provided them, pulling from her notebooks.

Jack testified about the psychological warfare, Raymond's philosophy, the delusion of radio immortality. Paulie explained the technical sabotage, the booby traps, the equipment modifications. Leon described the SOS broadcast, the emergency response. Shelly spoke about parasocial relationships, about loving a voice, about the graves that broke her denial.

Marie testified about the evidence. The systematic documentation. The twenty-year timeline. The methodology. The victims.

She watched prosecutors build their case, even though the killer was dead. The case mattered for closure. For understanding. For ensuring victims were recognized and their families had answers. For making certain the justice system acknowledged what had happened here.

Week twelve: Psychological evaluation of Raymond Peck. Posthumous, based on journals and witness testimony.

The forensic psychologist's report was clinical:

*"Subject displayed functional delusional disorder with highly systematized beliefs around radio transmission and consciousness preservation. Following traumatic loss of spouse in 1961, subject developed elaborate rationalization equating electromagnetic broadcast with human consciousness continuation. This delusion was reinforced through repeated actions over twenty years, becoming increasingly elaborate and immutable.*

*Subject demonstrated high intelligence, meticulous organizational skills, and ability to present as socially appropriate while maintaining completely divorced internal belief system. Classic organized serial killer profile with additional delusional component that subject genuinely believed was altruistic.*

*Margaret Peck's death serves as clear inciting trauma. Subject's inability to process grief led to construction of technological solution to death—radio preservation. First murder of Thomas Hendricks reinforced delusion when subject discovered recording death created 'authentic emotional resonance' in victim's voice.*

*Subject was not legally insane—understood laws, consequences, nature of killing. But operated from completely alternate belief framework where murder was transformation, death was preservation, broadcasting was immortality.*

*No effective intervention would have been possible. Delusion too systematized, too reinforced by repeated success, too central to subject's identity.*"

Marie read the evaluation three times. Tried to find something that explained how a person became this. How grief turned into systematic murder. How love for a dead wife justified thirty-two deaths.

The evaluation offered no comfort. Just clinical acknowledgment that Raymond Peck had been both brilliant and completely insane.

Week sixteen: Case closed. Raymond Peck officially ruled responsible for thirty-two murders between 1963 and 1982. Cause of death: self-immolation during destruction of evidence. No accomplices. No additional victims identified.

Families were offered resources. Therapy. Victims' compensation. Some of Raymond's tape recordings—the ones that survived the fire—for those who wanted to hear their loved ones' voices one final time.

Most declined.

Marie attended memorial services. Thirty-two of them, scattered across three states. Each victim remembered. Names spoken. Photos displayed. Families given closure after years or decades of not knowing.

At Thomas Hendricks' memorial, his sister approached Marie.

"Thank you," she said. "For documenting everything. For making sure people know what happened. For making sure Thomas mattered."

"He mattered before I documented anything," Marie said.

"But now everyone knows that," the sister replied. "Now he's not just a missing person. He's a victim. There's a difference."

Marie added that to her notes. The difference between being missing and being mourned.

Week twenty: Life resuming. Jack returned to college radio, his overnight show different now. More careful. Less trusting of vocal intimacy. Paulie worked his studio job, refused to record anyone without explicit written consent. Leon's conspiracy theories were validated—sometimes paranoia is pattern recognition ahead of its time. Shelly started therapy, learning to distinguish connection from obsession.

They stayed in touch. Trauma-bonded. Monthly phone calls, sharing how they were processing. Planning to visit each other, though none of them had yet. The thought of being in the same place brought back too many memories.

Marie finished her thesis. Dedicated it to the thirty-two victims. Submitted it to Penn State with appendices documenting Raymond's methodology, FCC failures, and recommendations for preventing future exploitation of regulatory gaps.

She received highest honors. Thesis nominated for national awards. Publishers reached out about expanding it into a book.

Marie declined. Some documentation was for justice, for closure, for ensuring victims were remembered.

Not for profit.

Week twenty-four: Final report completed. Marie compiled everything into a master file. 847 pages. Timeline. Victim profiles. Evidence catalogue. Witness testimonies. Media coverage. Psychological evaluation. FCC investigation. Recommendations.

She submitted it to the FBI, the prosecutors, the victims' families who wanted it.

Then she closed her notebook.

The documentation was complete. The case was closed. Raymond Peck's twenty-year preservation project had been fully documented, fully understood, fully ended.

Thirty-two victims identified. Thirty-two families given closure. One serial killer dead by his own delusion.

Justice, Marie supposed, though it felt incomplete. The dead remained dead. The trauma remained. The questions about how someone could believe murder was preservation—those remained unanswered despite 847 pages of documentation.

But the work was done.

Marie looked at her thesis, at the dedication page:

*"For Thomas, Patricia, Michael, Jennifer, David, and the twenty-seven others whose voices were stolen. You mattered. You are remembered. You will not be forgotten."*

The opposite of Raymond's preservation. Not voices trapped in recordings. But names spoken freely, remembered with consent, mourned properly.

That was the only immortality that mattered.

The documentation was complete.

Now came the harder part: learning to live with what she'd documented.
