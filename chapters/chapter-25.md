# Chapter 25: Sabotage and Feedback

Paulie's hands moved fast, disconnecting safety circuits while Jack's broadcast filled the speakers. Emergency message repeating over and over. Coordinates being transmitted to every ranger station, every police frequency within range. Raymond Peck's name going out across three states. Serial killer. Thirty-two victims. Twenty years of systematic murder.

The transmitter sat open in front of him, guts exposed like an animal being dissected. Vacuum tubes glowing hot orange. High-voltage components live and dangerous, crackling with electricity. One wrong move would electrocute him or destroy the equipment they desperately needed.

But Paulie had been working on audio equipment his whole life—since he was twelve years old helping his father repair televisions, since his first job at the recording studio, since hundreds of maintenance sessions on broadcast equipment. His hands knew what to do even when his brain was screaming about the serial killer ten feet away swinging an axe at Jack's booth.

Focus. Technical problems had technical solutions.

He cross-wired the transmitter's power regulator, bypassing Raymond's careful safety margins. The station was designed to broadcast at legal limits—carefully controlled power to avoid FCC detection. Paulie stripped those controls away. Rerouted power from the generator directly to the transmitter.

Maximum output. Every watt the generator could provide.

Jack's emergency broadcast would reach three states. Maybe four. Every radio tuned to this frequency would hear it crystal clear.

Next: the feedback loop. Paulie grabbed patch cables, connected the broadcast output back into the input. Created an audio loop that would amplify itself exponentially. The whine would be painful, disorienting. But more importantly, it would prevent Raymond from using the equipment even if he got past Jack.

He twisted the feedback control dial. Nothing happened initially. Then—

A high-pitched whine erupted from every speaker in the building. Low at first, building quickly. The frequency climbed, hitting that painful range where ears hurt and thought becomes difficult.

Through the window, Paulie saw Raymond stop mid-axe swing. The sound hit him like a physical force. He dropped the axe, clutched his ears.

"What are you doing?" Raymond screamed. Not at Jack. At the equipment. At Paulie. "You're destroying it! Twenty years of maintenance! The transmitter can't handle this power! You'll burn it out!"

Good, Paulie thought. He pushed the power higher.

The feedback whine became unbearable. Paulie grabbed the noise-canceling headphones from the bench, jammed them over his ears. Muffled but not eliminated. The sound was everywhere, vibrating through the floor, the walls, the air itself.

Raymond abandoned the broadcast booth. Turned toward the equipment room. His face was different now—no grandfatherly warmth. Just desperate panic. A man watching his life's work destroyed in real-time.

He reached for the equipment room door.

Leon intercepted him.

Paulie watched through the window as Leon—thin, nervous Leon who spent his life scanning radio frequencies from his apartment—grabbed Raymond and shoved him back. Not graceful. Not trained. Just fear-driven defense.

Raymond stumbled, caught himself. Looked at Leon with genuine confusion.

"Leon," Raymond said. Paulie could barely hear him over the feedback whine. "You understand patterns. You've seen the beauty in my work. The systematic preservation. Why would you destroy it?"

"Because it's murder," Leon shouted.

They grappled. Awkward, desperate. Leon had youth and fear-driven adrenaline. Raymond had desperate purpose and twenty years of practice subduing victims. They crashed into the wall, knocking vintage radio equipment to the floor.

Paulie kept working. Feedback loop stable. Power at maximum. Now for the final modification—override every safety, every circuit breaker, every fuse. Force the entire system to broadcast Jack's message until the equipment literally melted.

Raymond might be able to rebuild eventually. But not before authorities arrived. Not before the evidence was secured.

His hands moved through the transmitter's guts. Disconnecting mercury switches. Disarming fire traps. Twenty years of Raymond's protective measures stripped away in five minutes by someone who actually understood audio engineering.

"You're all insane!" Raymond screamed. He'd thrown Leon off, was advancing toward the equipment room again. "I'm trying to save you! Give you immortality! And you're destroying the only system that can preserve human consciousness beyond death!"

Paulie looked up. Made eye contact through the window. Reached for the main power bus.

"Don't," Raymond said. Reading Paulie's intention. "Please. That's the primary transmission system. Without it, all the voices stop. Everyone I've saved—Margaret, Thomas, Jennifer, all of them—they'll be silenced. You'll kill them."

"They're already dead," Paulie said. Raymond couldn't hear through the glass and feedback whine, but he seemed to understand from Paulie's lips.

Paulie cross-wired the power bus. Removed every current limiter. Connected maximum generator output directly to the transmitter.

The equipment hummed, power building beyond safe levels. Tubes glowed brighter. Heat radiated from the housing. This would burn out in minutes. But minutes was all they needed.

Raymond's face crumpled. "No. No. You're destroying everything beautiful. Everything I built. Margaret—"

"Margaret's dead!" Shelly's voice cut through the feedback whine.

She stood at the basement stairs, arms full of evidence tapes. Raymond's tape library. The preservation project. But more than that—she held the glass case. Margaret's tape. The twenty-three-second recording that started everything.

"Is this what you want, Raymond?" Shelly shouted. "To watch everything burn? To lose Margaret again?"

She held the tape case over the stair railing. Twenty feet to concrete floor below.

Raymond froze. "Don't. Please. That's all I have left of her. The only—"

"Then stop," Shelly said. "Let us broadcast. Let the authorities come. Face what you've done."

For a moment, Raymond stood paralyzed. His eyes moved between Paulie at the transmitter, the feedback-screaming speakers, Shelly holding Margaret's tape, Leon recovering against the wall, Jack in the booth still broadcasting coordinates.

His entire delusion collapsing simultaneously.

"I saved them," Raymond whispered. Paulie could barely hear, had to read lips. "All of them. I gave them voices that would never die. That's not murder. That's... that's love. That's defeating death. How can you not see that?"

"Because it's insane," Paulie said. Still working, making final connections. "You're insane, Raymond. Brilliant audio engineer. Meticulous record-keeper. Absolutely, completely insane."

Raymond's face hardened. No more pleading. No more explanation. Just cold certainty.

"If I can't preserve you," Raymond said, "then no one will be preserved. If the broadcasts end, everyone ends."

He turned and ran. Not toward Shelly. Not toward Paulie. Toward the storage room where maintenance supplies were kept.

Where the kerosene can for the generator lived.

"Oh no," Leon said. "He's going to burn it."

"Stop him!" Jack shouted, bursting from the broadcast booth.

But Raymond was already there. Grabbing the metal can. Unscrewing the cap. The smell of kerosene filled the station building, cutting through even the feedback whine.

"I'd rather destroy it than let you take it," Raymond said. His voice had changed completely. No warmth. No broadcaster smoothness. Just broken certainty. "If the tapes are silenced, if the broadcasts end, then at least they end on my terms. Not yours. Not the authorities'. Mine."

He started pouring kerosene. Over the equipment. Over the broadcast booth door. Over the floor leading to the basement where the tape library waited.

"Margaret will forgive me," Raymond said. "She'll understand. We'll be together in the fire. Both of us finally silent. Both of us finally preserved in death instead of recording."

Shelly backed away from the stairs, still holding Margaret's tape. "Raymond, don't—"

"Give her to me," Raymond said. "Let me hold Margaret's voice one more time. Then we can all burn together. Five voices, thirty-two voices, all of us transmitting through fire instead of radio waves."

He pulled out a box of matches.

The building reeked of kerosene. The feedback whine screamed through speakers. Jack's emergency broadcast still transmitted at maximum power. And Raymond Peck stood in the center of his life's work, ready to burn it all down.

"Put down the matches," Marie said. She'd emerged from the basement, evidence boxes in her arms. "Raymond, if you light that fire, you'll destroy the only proof that these people existed. Their voices, their recordings—families need that. They need closure. Don't take that from them."

"Families need to know their loved ones mattered," Raymond said. "That they didn't just disappear into nothing. I gave them that. I preserved them. And now you're all trying to silence them. I won't allow it."

He struck a match.

The tiny flame reflected in his bifocals. Reflected in Margaret's photograph still in his pocket. Reflected in twenty-one years of grief and delusion and systematic murder converging on this single moment.

"Your voices were supposed to be beautiful," Raymond said sadly. Looking at each of them. "Supposed to broadcast forever. Instead you choose this. Destruction. Silence. Death."

He dropped the match.

And Paulie realized with horror that twenty years of careful audio engineering, of preserved voices, of systematic recording was about to be consumed by fire started by the man who'd created it all.

The match fell in slow motion, spinning through air toward kerosene-soaked floor.

The battle for voices had become a race against flame.
