# Chapter 7: Dead Voices

Leon had been called paranoid his entire adult life. Conspiracy theorist. Crazy. The guy who saw patterns that weren't there, connections that didn't exist.

Except this time, the patterns were real.

He sat at the bunkhouse table, three years of Night Caller logs spread before him. Three notebooks, filled cover to cover with his careful handwriting: dates, times, callers, song requests. Every broadcast he'd listened to since 1979, documented meticulously.

People made fun of him for it. His coworkers at the factory, the few family members who still talked to him, even his therapist. "Obsessive," they said. "Unhealthy fixation."

But Leon had learned long ago that the only person he could trust was himself. So he kept records. Tracked patterns. Looked for the signals everyone else missed.

And now, at 1 AM in a mountaintop bunkhouse, he was about to prove he'd been right all along.

"Jenny from Bristol," he said, pointing to his log entry from two nights ago. "Requested 'Stand By Me.' Called in at 10:23 PM."

Marie looked up from her newspaper archives, illuminated by Coleman lantern light. "What about her?"

"I've heard her before. Multiple times." Leon flipped back through his notes. "Here. September 15th, 1982. Same request, same time. And before that—July 3rd, 1982. April 12th. February 8th."

"Same caller requesting the same song," Jack said. "People have favorites."

"Eight times in less than a year?" Leon shook his head. "Same greeting, same conversation, same request. Paulie proved they're identical recordings. So I started thinking—who is Jenny from Bristol?"

He pushed Marie's newspaper archives toward her. "Can you look? Bristol, Tennessee or Virginia. Last name probably Holcomb—I heard Raymond use it once, might've been a slip."

Marie sorted through obituaries, using the indexing system she'd developed. Jack and Paulie watched. Shelly sat apart, arms crossed, radiating hostility.

"Here," Marie said quietly. "Jennifer Holcomb. Bristol, Tennessee. Died March 1978. Age twenty-six. Survived by mother Clara and—" She stopped.

"What?" Leon asked.

"Survived by mother Clara, who filed an FCC complaint in 1979 about hearing her dead daughter's voice on a pirate radio broadcast." Marie looked up, face pale. "The Night Caller."

The bunkhouse went silent except for the wood stove's crackle and the wind outside.

Leon felt his heart pounding. He'd suspected, but having it confirmed was different. Made it real.

"Thomas from Asheville," he said, voice steadier than he felt. "He's been calling in for years. Decades, maybe. Always requests 'Blue Moon.' Always mentions his wife."

Marie didn't need prompting this time. She searched the older archives, newspapers from the sixties. Found it quickly.

"Thomas Hendricks. Asheville, North Carolina. Died November 1963. Age thirty-four." She read further. "His brother filed an FCC complaint in December 1963. Claimed to hear Thomas's voice on an illegal radio broadcast."

"He died in '63," Jack said slowly. "That's almost twenty years ago. His voice has been on the show for twenty years?"

"Longer than I've been alive," Leon muttered. He consulted his logs. "I have six more regular callers. People I've heard repeatedly. Can we check them?"

They spent the next hour cross-referencing. Leon read names and details. Marie searched obituaries. The pattern held.

Angela from Roanoke requesting "Dream a Little Dream": Angela Martinez, died 1971. FCC complaint filed by her sister in 1972.

David from Charlotte asking for "Georgia on My Mind": David Monroe, died September 1982. Mother filed complaint October 1982—two weeks ago.

Michael from Knoxville wanting "What a Wonderful World": Michael Chen, died 1975. Father filed complaint 1976.

Sarah from Richmond requesting "Unforgettable": Sarah Williams, died 1969. No FCC complaint found, but obituary confirmed.

One after another. Eight callers Leon had logged. Eight obituaries. Eight dead people's voices playing on The Night Caller, requesting songs, chatting with Raymond, sounding alive.

"This isn't possible," Shelly said, but her voice wavered. "People don't—you can't just—"

"The FCC complaints," Marie said, laying them out. "Families heard their dead loved ones. Thought they were going crazy, or hearing things, or ghosts using radio waves. But they were right. Their relatives really were on the broadcasts."

"Playing from recordings made before they died," Jack added. "Or..."

He didn't finish, but Leon knew what he meant. Or recordings made as they died.

"No," Shelly stood abruptly. "Raymond isn't a killer. He runs a radio show. You're connecting things that aren't connected. Coincidence. Reused audio. Tribute to dead listeners. Anything but murder."

"Eight people?" Paulie asked. "Eight coincidences?"

"Yes! Why not? Lots of people die. Raymond's been broadcasting for twenty years. Some listeners died during that time. So what?"

Leon pulled out his oldest notebook, the one he'd filled first. "I started listening in 1979. Three years ago. In that time, I've logged seventy-three distinct callers across hundreds of broadcasts."

"So?"

"So I just identified eight who are confirmed dead. That's eleven percent. If eleven percent of people calling a radio show are dead, either the show has really unlucky demographics or something else is happening."

He did the math on paper, showing his work. Normal mortality rate for people aged twenty to forty—the typical Night Caller demographic based on voices—was maybe half a percent per year. But Raymond's callers showed eleven percent mortality over a mixed timeline.

Twenty times the normal rate.

"Statistics," Shelly said dismissively. "You can make numbers say anything."

"Can I?" Leon showed her the numbers. "This is basic epidemiology. If eleven percent of any population subset is dead, you investigate. Because populations don't die at twenty times normal rates unless something's killing them."

"Maybe Raymond attracts older listeners," Shelly tried. "Sick people, lonely people, people who—"

"Jenny Holcomb was twenty-six," Marie said quietly. "David Monroe was thirty. Michael Chen was twenty-nine. These aren't elderly people dying of natural causes."

Leon watched Shelly's face, saw the denial struggling against accumulating evidence. He knew that struggle. He'd lived it for years, seeing patterns others dismissed, being told he was wrong until he doubted himself.

But this time, he wasn't wrong.

"The question," Jack said carefully, "is whether Raymond knew. Maybe he just replays old recordings, doesn't realize these people are dead."

"He knows," Leon said flatly. "He has to."

"How can you be sure?"

"Because he times it." Leon found specific examples in his logs. "Jenny Holcomb died March 1978. Her voice first appeared on broadcasts in April 1978—one month later. David Monroe died September 1982. His voice appeared October 1982. There's a pattern: person dies, voice appears on broadcast shortly after."

"They could've called in before they died," Shelly said desperately. "Recorded the call, the person died later, Raymond started using it."

"For nineteen years?" Leon pointed to Thomas Hendricks. "Died 1963. Voice still playing 1982. Raymond's been using this one recording for two decades. Either he's the most efficient archive system ever, or he's deliberately preserving these voices."

Marie was re-reading the FCC complaints with new understanding. "The families knew. When they heard their dead relatives on the broadcast, they knew something was wrong. But the FCC dismissed them."

"Because it sounds insane," Paulie said. "Dead people on the radio. Of course they thought families were grief-delusional."

"But they weren't." Jack's voice was tight. "They heard real voices. Real recordings. The FCC should've investigated."

"They tried," Marie said. "Look. Every complaint shows FCC field agents attempted to locate the broadcast source. They failed. Signal bouncing, remote location, sophisticated evasion. Raymond stayed hidden."

Leon felt a chill that had nothing to do with the October cold. "He's been doing this for twenty years. Killing people, recording them, broadcasting their voices. How many? How many people?"

"Eight that we can confirm," Marie said. "But Leon, you only logged seventy-three callers over three years. How many total across twenty years?"

The math was ugly. If eight dead voices appeared in three years of logging, the full twenty-year span could contain dozens. Maybe hundreds.

"We need to search more," Leon said. "All the archives, all the obituaries. Build a complete list."

"We need to leave," Shelly said, voice cracking. "Now. Right now. If what you're saying is true—if Raymond is a killer—we need to run."

But Leon was thinking about the contest. Five winners, invited to the station, trapped with cut phone lines and sabotaged van. He pulled out Raymond's contest announcement, which he'd saved: "Special weekend for my most dedicated listeners. Come experience The Night Caller in person."

Experience it. Or become it?

"The contest was a trap," he said aloud. "He selected us. Studied our entries. We're not guests."

"We're the next voices," Jack finished, his face ashen.

Shelly made a small sound, halfway between denial and terror.

Leon looked at each of them: Jack the college DJ with his intimate radio voice, Marie the researcher with her crisp academic delivery, Paulie the engineer with his technical vocabulary, himself with his obsessive detailed observations, Shelly with her devoted fan worship.

Five distinct voices. Five personalities. Material for years of broadcasts.

"How does he do it?" Paulie asked quietly. "How does he record them?"

No one answered, but Leon's mind was already working through possibilities. The station had recording equipment. Soundproof rooms. Isolation. Raymond could invite people, make them comfortable, record hours of conversation before they realized anything was wrong.

And then?

Leon didn't want to think about "and then."

"The basement," Marie said suddenly. "When we searched the station, did anyone check for a basement?"

"Just the first floor and broadcast booth," Jack said. "Why?"

"Because recording equipment requires space. Storage. If Raymond has years of victim recordings, he needs somewhere to keep them. Somewhere secure. Hidden."

"And," Leon added, following her logic, "somewhere to do the recording. Somewhere soundproofed. Isolated. Where people wouldn't be heard."

They looked at each other, understanding settling like frost.

"Tomorrow morning," Jack said. "First light. We search for a basement. Document everything. Then we hike out regardless of weather and report this to authorities."

"Why wait?" Shelly asked. "Why not leave now?"

"Because it's 1 AM, fog is thick, and we'd get lost in minutes," Paulie said pragmatically. "We have light, supplies, and a locked bunkhouse. We're safer staying put until dawn."

Leon wasn't sure he agreed. Every instinct screamed to run. But Paulie was right—hiking in darkness through mountain fog was suicide.

"We take shifts," Marie said. "Two people awake at all times. Door locked. No one goes outside alone."

They divided the night: Jack and Marie first watch, then Paulie and Leon, then back to Jack and Shelly at dawn. Simple. Defensive.

But as Leon tried to sleep, his mind wouldn't stop cataloging patterns. Eight dead voices. Twenty years of murder. Sophisticated recording equipment. Automation designed to broadcast victims forever.

And somewhere in these mountains, Raymond Peck, the warm voice that made loneliness bearable, collected new sounds.

New voices.

For his eternal broadcast.
