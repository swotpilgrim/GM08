# Chapter 2: Welcome to the Night Caller

The bunkhouse smelled like pine and wood smoke. Five beds lined the walls, each with clean wool blankets. On the table: bottled water, canned goods, a Coleman lantern, a transistor radio. Everything they'd need for a weekend.

Everything except the person who'd prepared it.

"This is nice." Shelly ran her hand over one of the blankets. "Really thoughtful. See? He wanted us to be comfortable."

Marie was examining the cabinets along the back wall. She tried the handles—locked, all of them. "Why lock storage in a guest bunkhouse?"

"Maybe that's where he keeps equipment," Paulie suggested. "Broadcasting gear, maintenance stuff. Doesn't want guests messing with it."

"Or personal items," Jack added, though he wasn't sure he believed it. The cabinets looked industrial, the kind with heavy padlocks. Not exactly standard guest accommodation.

Leon peered through a gap in one cabinet's door. "Can't see anything. Too dark."

"Leave it alone." Shelly's voice had an edge. "Raymond said make ourselves comfortable. That doesn't mean snooping."

"He also said he'd be here," Marie countered quietly.

An uncomfortable silence settled. Paulie checked the wood stove, Leon tested the water bottles, Marie photographed the room, Shelly straightened blankets that didn't need straightening.

Outside, the daylight was fading fast. Through the bunkhouse window, Jack could see the compound settling into shadow. The transmission tower stood black against the deepening blue sky, its red warning lights beginning to blink. One. Two. Three. Pause. Repeat.

He should feel excited. This was what he'd hoped for—learning from The Night Caller himself, seeing behind the curtain. Instead, Jack felt hollow. The empty compound, the pre-recorded message, the locked doors. None of it matched what he'd imagined.

"I'm going to look around more," Marie said, pulling on her jacket. "Before it gets too dark."

"Want company?" Jack asked.

"Sure."

They left Shelly fussing with the beds, Paulie examining the radio, Leon poking through supplies. Outside, the October cold bit harder than expected. Jack zipped his denim jacket, wishing for something heavier.

Marie walked to the generator shed. Padlocked, but through the grimy window they could see the generator—industrial, probably diesel, running steadily.

"So he's been here recently enough to start that," Marie said. "Generators don't run themselves."

"Could be automated," Jack offered. "Timer system."

"Could be." But she didn't sound convinced.

They circled the main building. Square, utilitarian, thirty by forty feet. Jack tried the door—still locked. He peered through the window, cupping his hands against the glass.

Inside: shapes in darkness. A desk, chairs, equipment racks. Everything neat, waiting. But no lights, no movement.

"There has to be another entrance," Marie said. "Fire code would require it, even for an illegal station."

They found it on the back side: another locked door, and a small window. Jack knelt, looking in. Workshop or storage. Shelves, tools on pegboard, a workbench.

"He maintains everything himself," Jack said. "Can't call repair services for illegal equipment."

Marie took a photo. "Twenty years of self-sufficiency."

Or obsession, Jack thought.

They circled to the tower. Its base surrounded by chain-link with a locked gate. WARNING signs: HIGH VOLTAGE. NO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. Jack tilted his head back—two hundred feet of steel, transmission equipment humming at the top.

"Beautiful," Marie said quietly. "Scary too."

They stood looking up. Red warning lights blinking. In the forest, something moved. Jack's pulse jumped.

"Let's get back," he said.

Marie nodded.

As they walked back, Marie asked, "What do you really think happened?"

"I don't know. Emergency in town, maybe."

"Do you believe that?"

Jack thought about it. "Contest winners visiting a pirate station? Raymond revealing his location after twenty years hiding from the FCC? It seemed too good to be true."

"But we wanted it to be real."

"Yeah."

"I still do. This is my thesis. If I can interview Raymond, document his operation—that's primary source material nobody else has."

"And if he doesn't come back?"

"Document what I can and hike out tomorrow." She looked at him. "You?"

"Raymond was my hero. I wanted to learn from him." Jack shrugged. "I don't know anymore."

They reached the bunkhouse. Inside, Paulie had the wood stove going, orange light flickering through the grate. Leon was reading labels on cans of soup. Shelly sat on one of the beds, arms wrapped around herself.

"Find anything?" Paulie asked.

"Generator's running," Marie said. "Everything else is locked."

"So we wait," Shelly said firmly. "Like he asked. He'll be here tomorrow morning."

No one argued, though Jack saw Leon and Marie exchange a look.

The temperature dropped as full darkness arrived. They ate cold sandwiches from their own supplies—none willing to open Raymond's canned goods yet. Jack sat near the wood stove, feeling the heat. Outside, wind sighed through pine trees.

At quarter to nine, Paulie got up. "I'm going to check the main building one more time."

"It's locked," Shelly said.

"I know. Just want to see if any lights come on. Maybe Raymond's there and we just missed him."

"I'll come," Leon said.

They left with a flashlight. Through the window, Jack watched their beam sweep the compound, the main building's door, the windows. Nothing. The building stayed dark.

They returned minutes later, shaking their heads.

Then, at five minutes to nine, they all heard it: a heavy mechanical sound. Chunk-clack. Like a deadbolt sliding home.

Jack was on his feet immediately. "What was that?"

"Came from the station," Leon said.

They piled out into the cold night. Jack's breath made clouds in the flashlight beam as they approached the main building. Paulie tried the door—still locked. They circled around. The back door—also locked.

"I know I heard something," Leon insisted.

"We all did," Marie said.

Paulie knelt by the front door, examining the lock with his flashlight. "Electronic," he said. "See the keypad? Probably programmable. Could be on a timer."

"A timer that locks us out at nine PM?" Marie's voice was sharp.

"Or locks something in," Leon said quietly.

Shelly hugged herself. "Let's go back to the bunkhouse. Please. It's freezing."

They walked back in silence. The compound felt different in darkness—spaces between buildings deeper, shadows absolute. The generator hummed. Tower lights blinked. Something moved through dead leaves in the forest.

Inside, they clustered near the wood stove. Jack's watch read 9:47 PM.

"Almost time," Shelly said softly.

"For what?" Marie asked.

"The broadcast. Ten PM. He said to tune in, remember?"

Paulie reached for the transistor radio on the table, extending the antenna. Static hissed as he turned the dial. More static. A fragment of news. More static. He adjusted carefully, searching for The Night Caller's frequency.

At exactly ten o'clock, the voice arrived.

"Good evening, listeners. You're with The Night Caller, here to keep you company through the dark hours."

Raymond's voice, warm as honey, filled the small bunkhouse.

Shelly's face transformed. Relief, vindication, something close to joy. "See? He's broadcasting. He's here."

But Marie was already moving toward the door. "Stay here," she said.

"Where are you going?"

"To see where that's coming from."

Jack followed her out. They ran across the compound to the main building, breath white in the cold air. Through the windows: still dark. No lights. No silhouette of someone in the broadcast booth.

Raymond's voice continued, drifting from somewhere: "We've got a beautiful night ahead. Lots of requests, and I'm feeling generous with my thoughts. First up, let's hear from Thomas in Asheville..."

"External speakers," Paulie said, appearing beside them. He pointed up. Mounted under the eaves: small weatherproof speakers, the kind used for outdoor PA systems. "Broadcasting the show to the compound."

"But where's it coming from?" Jack asked.

"Inside." Paulie pressed his face to the window. "Equipment's running. Look."

Jack looked. As his eyes adjusted, he could make out shapes in the darkness: dim lights on equipment racks, the faint glow of power indicators, something moving—tape reels slowly turning.

"It's automated," Marie breathed. "The whole broadcast is automated."

"That's impossible," Paulie said. "You can't automate live calls, station identification, weather comments. There has to be someone operating it."

But as they watched, the equipment continued its patient work. Tapes turning, lights glowing, and through the speakers, Raymond's voice asking Thomas about his family, what song he wanted.

"This is really wrong," Marie said.

A caller's voice responded—thin, distant, scratchy through the phone line: "Can you play 'Blue Moon'? My wife loves that song."

"Of course, Thomas. Beautiful choice. This one's for you and your wife."

The music started: The Marcels' "Blue Moon," doo-wop harmonies bright and cheerful.

The three of them stood in the cold night, watching an empty building broadcast a show that wasn't live, listening to a host who wasn't there.

"We should tell the others," Jack said finally.

They walked back to the bunkhouse in silence. Inside, Shelly and Leon were listening to the broadcast, Shelly with a small smile, Leon with a notebook open, jotting something down.

"Well?" Shelly looked up.

"It's automated," Marie said. "The building is empty. The equipment's running itself."

"That's not possible," Shelly said immediately.

"We just watched it," Paulie said. "Tape decks, turntables, switching equipment. All running with nobody there."

"Then he's somewhere else," Shelly insisted. "Sleeping quarters we didn't see. Monitoring from the tower. Something."

"Shelly—"

"He's HERE." Her voice rose. "The broadcast is happening. We can hear him. He's here somewhere."

Leon looked up from his notebook. "Actually," he said slowly, "that caller. Thomas from Asheville."

"What about him?"

"I've heard that request before. 'Blue Moon' for his wife. Same caller, same song. Last month's broadcast. I logged it."

Silence.

"You log The Night Caller's broadcasts?" Marie asked.

"Every show for three years. Dates, times, callers, songs." Leon tapped his notebook. "Thomas from Asheville. Requested 'Blue Moon' on September 15th. Exact same conversation."

"Maybe he called in again," Shelly said weakly.

"With the exact same words?"

Through the radio, Raymond's voice returned: "That was 'Blue Moon' for Thomas in Asheville. Beautiful dedication. Up next, we've got Jenny from Bristol with a special request..."

Leon's pencil scratched frantically in his notebook. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the bunkhouse door. The wood stove crackled. And from the dark compound beyond their small circle of warmth and light, the broadcast continued, Raymond's voice steady and intimate, playing songs for callers who may or may not have been real.

Jack looked at each of them in turn: Paulie frowning, calculating; Marie photographing Leon's notes; Leon writing faster; Shelly staring at the radio like it might provide answers if she stared hard enough.

"What are we doing here?" Jack asked quietly.

Nobody answered. Outside, the tower lights blinked their steady rhythm, red against the dark October sky. And The Night Caller broadcast on, voice in the darkness, company for the lonely.

But they'd never felt more alone.
