# Chapter 22: Raymond Arrives

The door opened.

Raymond Peck stepped into his station building like a man coming home from errands. Small, slight build. Cardigan sweater over a button-down shirt, both neat and well-maintained. Wire-rimmed bifocals catching the morning light. Thinning gray hair combed carefully. Soft-soled shoes making almost no sound on the floor.

He looked like someone's grandfather. A retired librarian. A kind neighbor who'd help you carry groceries.

Not a serial killer who'd murdered thirty-two people.

Jack felt his throat tighten. This was the disconnect Raymond's victims must have felt. Expecting danger and finding this gentle-looking man instead. Letting their guard down because how could someone who looked like this hurt anyone?

"Hello," Raymond said. His voice was exactly what Jack expected—warm, measured, the same tone that came through the broadcasts. "I'm glad you all stayed. I was worried you might have left."

No one spoke. They'd positioned themselves as planned: Jack near the broadcast booth, ready to engage. Leon by the equipment room, watching. Marie near the door, escape route clear. Paulie at the transmitter. Shelly standing between them all, frozen.

Raymond noticed their positions and smiled gently. "You don't need to be afraid. I'm not here to hurt you. I've told you that." He moved to the kitchenette, completely at ease. "Would anyone like coffee? I know it's been a difficult few days. You must be exhausted."

The coffee pot. Raymond's preferred method. Drugged coffee, victims relaxed and trusting before they realized what was happening.

"We're fine," Jack said. His voice came out steadier than he felt.

"Are you sure?" Raymond poured himself a cup, added sugar. Took a sip like they were having a normal conversation. "I always find coffee helps with difficult discussions."

Jack needed to engage him. Keep him talking. Buy time for Paulie to finish the transmitter setup, for Leon to be ready with the SOS. "We read your journals, Raymond. About Margaret. About how her death led to all of this."

Raymond's face softened. "Margaret." He set down his coffee cup, pulled a photograph from his cardigan pocket. The same one Jack had seen in the basement studio—a woman in her thirties, dark hair, genuine smile. "May 12, 1958. The day we married. She was twenty-six. I was thirty-four. We had three years together before the accident."

He spoke about her like she'd died yesterday, not twenty-one years ago.

"Car accident," Raymond continued. "March 17, 1961. Drunk driver ran a red light. She died instantly, they told me. Like that was supposed to be comforting. Instant. No suffering. But what about my suffering? What about losing the person who made silence bearable?"

Jack watched Raymond's hands. Gentle, careful hands. Hands that had killed thirty-two people. "You recorded her voice."

"One phone call," Raymond said. "We'd bought one of those new answering machines. Expensive, but Margaret loved gadgets. She left me a message one afternoon: 'Raymond, I'm running late. Start dinner without me. Love you.' Twenty-three seconds. That's all I had of her voice."

He pulled out a small reel-to-reel tape from his other pocket. Carried it with him, Jack realized. Margaret's voice, twenty-one years after death, still in Raymond's pocket.

"I played it every night," Raymond said. "Over and over. Her voice saying she loved me. It was the only thing that helped. But tape degrades, Jack. Did you know that? Every playback wears the magnetic coating. After six months, I could hear the degradation. Static creeping in. Her voice getting quieter. She was dying again, erased by physics and time."

Marie was taking notes, documenting everything. Raymond didn't seem to care.

"That's when I understood," Raymond said. "Death isn't biological. Death is silence. As long as Margaret's voice existed, she wasn't gone. But the tape was killing her. I needed a better way. Professional equipment, climate control, reel-to-reel systems that could preserve audio indefinitely."

"So you built the station," Jack said.

"I built a monument," Raymond corrected gently. "A place where voices could live forever. Where I could broadcast Margaret every night and keep her present in the world. The technical challenges were significant, but I've always been good with electronics. By 1962, I had the tower operational. Illegal, yes, but necessary. The FCC would never have approved what I was doing."

He sipped his coffee, completely relaxed. Like he was teaching a class, not confessing to decades of murder.

"For eighteen months, it was enough," Raymond said. "I played Margaret's voice between songs. Broadcast her laugh, her comments about weather, her love. And people listened. They found comfort in The Night Caller. I was helping them the way Margaret's voice helped me."

"Then Thomas Hendricks threatened to report you," Jack said.

Raymond's expression didn't change. "Thomas was a good man. Lonely, like so many of my listeners. But he noticed the splicing. Realized the voices weren't live. He said he'd report me to the FCC if I didn't stop. Said what I was doing was deception."

"It was deception," Marie said quietly.

Raymond looked at her with gentle disappointment. "No, Marie. It was preservation. Thomas didn't understand that. He would have ended the broadcasts. Ended Margaret's voice. I couldn't allow that."

"So you killed him," Jack said.

"I saved Margaret," Raymond said simply. "Thomas's death was... regrettable but necessary. I invited him to visit, to explain my work. I thought he might understand if he saw the equipment, heard Margaret's full archive. But he didn't. So I had to choose: Thomas Hendricks' temporary life, or Margaret's eternal voice."

The way he said it—matter-of-fact, logical—made Jack's skin crawl.

"And then you discovered something," Jack said. "About recording people before they died."

Raymond nodded, a teacher pleased his student was following along. "That's when I understood death's true nature. When I recorded Thomas before his passing, when I captured his voice at the moment of transition, there was a quality to it. Authentic emotional resonance. His voice carried more life in those final hours than it ever had on phone calls."

He pulled out a small cassette player. Pressed play.

A man's voice, terrified: "Why are you doing this? Please, I won't tell anyone, just let me go—"

Raymond's voice, calm: "Shh, Thomas. I'm preserving you. You'll never be forgotten now. Your voice will broadcast forever."

Jack felt sick. Raymond had brought a tape of his first murder. Was playing it like a fond memory.

Raymond stopped the playback. "Thomas broadcasts every third Thursday at 11:47 PM. He requests 'Blue Moon.' People hear him and feel less alone. I gave him that. Eternal purpose."

"You killed him," Shelly said, her voice breaking. "You killed all of them."

Raymond looked at her with genuine affection. "Shelly. You understand loneliness better than most. Your letters to me, your contest entries—you've been dying slowly from isolation. Your mother's criticism, your small town, your bank teller job where nobody really sees you. You've been fading for years."

Shelly backed away.

"I'm offering you immortality," Raymond said gently. "Your voice broadcast forever. People across three states hearing you, being comforted by you. Isn't that better than slow erasure in Tennessee?"

"That's not life," Jack said. "That's imprisonment. They didn't consent to being recorded. To being broadcast. You chose for them."

"I chose salvation over oblivion," Raymond corrected. "Yes, the physical body dies. But the voice—the essential self—continues. Radio waves carry human consciousness across distance and time. Broadcast voices exist in listeners' minds. That's more real than flesh, which decays. More real than bones, which turn to dust."

He believed it. Completely. No doubt, no rationalization. Raymond Peck genuinely believed that broadcasting voices meant defeating death.

"You said you're not delusional about killing," Marie said, still documenting. "You admit you end lives."

"Of course," Raymond said. "The transition requires the physical body to stop. Otherwise the voice remains anchored to dying flesh. But once separated through death and preserved through recording, the voice achieves its true form. Pure sound. Pure self. Transmitting forever."

He looked at each of them. Jack felt evaluated, measured.

"You've all been selected carefully," Raymond said. "Not random contest winners. I studied your voices, your lives, your isolation. Jack—you understand radio intimacy. You know what it means to be a voice in the dark. Marie—your analytical precision gives your voice authority. Paulie—technical knowledge adds depth. Leon—enthusiastic passion. Shelly—vulnerable hope. Together, you'll create beautiful broadcasts."

Paulie had moved slightly, positioning himself at the transmitter. Raymond noticed but didn't seem concerned.

"I know what you're planning," Raymond said. "The emergency frequency. The SOS. Bringing authorities here." He smiled gently. "It won't work. Even if you broadcast, even if rangers come, I'll have preserved you by then. Your voices will be on tape. The transition will be complete. Authorities can arrest me, destroy the equipment, bulldoze this compound—but your voices will have already broadcast. Already entered the eternal."

"You're willing to be arrested?" Jack asked.

"I'm willing to complete my work," Raymond said. "Twenty years of preservation. Thirty-two voices already broadcasting. Five more will make thirty-seven. A perfect collection. And then..." He looked at Margaret's photograph. "Then I can join them. Preserve my own voice. Broadcast with Margaret forever. Neither of us alone again."

He was planning to die. To record his own voice and somehow arrange for it to broadcast after death. Join Margaret in radio immortality.

"The coffee," Raymond said, gesturing to the pot. "It's already prepared. Sedatives mixed in. You'll drink, fall asleep gradually, wake in the recording studio. I'll spend hours talking with you, capturing your voices in conversation. You'll tell me about your lives, your dreams, your fears. All of it preserved. Then, when the recordings are complete, the transition will be gentle. Quiet. You won't suffer."

No one moved toward the coffee.

Raymond sighed. "I understand your hesitation. Everyone resists initially. They see preservation as ending when it's actually beginning. But I can't force you to understand. I can only preserve you anyway."

He reached into his cardigan pocket. Pulled out a syringe.

"If you won't drink the coffee," Raymond said, his voice still gentle, still The Night Caller's warm tones, "then we'll do this the difficult way. The recordings are better when you're calm, but I can work with distressed vocals. Fear has its own authentic resonance."

Jack's heart hammered. This was it. The moment everything turned from psychological warfare to survival.

Raymond looked at each of them with grandfatherly affection. "You'll thank me eventually. When your voices are broadcasting across three states, when you're part of the eternal transmission, you'll understand what I've given you."

He stepped toward them.

And five people prepared to fight for their lives against a man who believed murder was salvation.
