# Chapter 27: The Fire

The basement was already burning when Jack reached the stairs.

"Leon!" Jack shouted into the smoke. "Get out! Now!"

Leon emerged from the basement, coughing, eyes streaming. "He lit it. Raymond—he's down there with the tapes. He won't leave."

Behind Leon, orange light flickered. The kerosene had caught fast, spreading across the tape library. Twenty years of systematic recording going up in flames. Thirty-two voices being destroyed by the man who'd claimed to preserve them forever.

Smoke poured up the stairwell. The old station building—wood paneling, soundproofing foam from the 1960s, vinyl furniture—was a tinderbox waiting for ignition.

"Everyone out!" Jack yelled. "Paulie! Marie! Shelly! Get out now!"

Through the smoke, Jack saw Raymond in the basement. Standing in the center of the fire, cradling Margaret's tape case. His cardigan was smoking. His hands were blistered from grabbing burning tapes. But he wasn't screaming. Wasn't running. Just stood there, speaking to the tape he held.

"I won't let them take you," Raymond said to Margaret's voice. His real voice, not the broadcaster's warmth. Raw. Broken. Human. "We'll be together. Both of us. Fire instead of radio. But still together. Always together."

He looked up at Jack through the flames. Tears streaming down his face, mixing with smoke residue. "You don't understand. You never understood. These voices—they're alive. And I'm letting them all die rather than letting authorities silence them. That's love, Jack. That's real preservation."

"That's suicide!" Jack shouted.

"That's immortality," Raymond said. He opened Margaret's tape case. Held the reel in his burned hands. "Margaret, I'm coming. We'll broadcast together in whatever comes next."

The basement ceiling started to collapse. Burning soundproofing falling in chunks.

"Raymond, get out!" Jack reached down the stairs but the heat drove him back.

"I can't leave them," Raymond said. He looked at the burning tape library. Hundreds of reels turning to smoke and ash. "They're alive in these recordings. If I leave them to burn alone, they die alone. I won't do that. I've spent twenty years making sure no one dies alone."

A beam fell, missing Raymond by inches.

"Paulie!" Jack yelled. "Is everyone out?"

Paulie appeared through the smoke, Marie and Shelly behind him. They had evidence boxes, whatever they could carry from the basement before the fire spread.

"Generator room's filling with smoke," Paulie said. "If the fire reaches the fuel tanks—"

The explosion cut him off.

Not the generator—not yet—but something in the equipment room. Maybe the transmitter power supply. Maybe the booby-trapped circuits finally triggering. The blast shook the building, blew out windows, sent everyone stumbling.

Jack's ears rang. Smoke everywhere. The broadcast booth was engulfed in flames. The equipment room burning. And below, Raymond still standing in the basement as fire consumed everything around him.

"We have to go!" Marie shouted. "Now!"

They ran for the door. Outside, October air hit Jack's lungs, cold and clean after the smoke. He gasped, coughing, eyes burning.

Behind them, the station building roared with flame. The transmission tower groaned—200 feet of metal and cable, supports failing as fire weakened the structure. It swayed, cables snapping with sounds like gunshots.

"Raymond's still inside," Paulie said. "We have to—"

"He won't come out," Leon said. Coughing. Soot-stained. "He chose this. He lit the fire himself."

The tower groaned again. Louder. The whole structure tilting as base supports melted.

"It's coming down!" Shelly screamed.

They ran further from the building, into the compound yard. Turned back to watch.

The transmission tower fell in slow motion. 200 feet of steel bending, breaking, crashing into the burning station building. The impact drove flames higher, sent sparks into the October sky. More explosions—definitely the generator now, fuel tanks igniting.

The compound became an inferno.

Through the flames, Jack thought he heard screaming. Raymond's voice, finally stripped of its broadcaster warmth. Just a man screaming as fire consumed him and everything he'd built.

Then silence. Just the roar of flames.

The five of them stood in the compound yard, smoke-stained and shaking. Evidence boxes scattered around them. The graves marked with wooden markers untouched by flame. And the station—Raymond's life's work, his immortality project, twenty years of systematic murder and delusional preservation—burning to rubble.

"Is he...?" Shelly couldn't finish.

"Yes," Marie said quietly. "He's dead."

They watched the fire burn through the afternoon. Nothing to do but wait. The road was twenty-three miles away. Rangers were coming, Leon had confirmed it, but until they arrived the group could only sit in the grass and watch Raymond's compound be destroyed.

Jack thought about Raymond's last words. *They're alive in these recordings.* The delusion so complete, so absolute, that he'd chosen to burn rather than let authorities take his tapes. Chosen death over life because he genuinely believed the recordings were more real than his physical body.

Thirty-two people murdered. Thirty-two voices preserved and broadcast without consent. And in the end, Raymond had destroyed them all himself. The preservation project consumed by fire, the voices silenced by the man who'd claimed to give them immortality.

"The tapes," Shelly said. "They're all gone. Families won't be able to hear their loved ones' voices."

"We have some," Marie said, indicating the evidence boxes they'd carried out. "Not many. Maybe a dozen reels. But enough to prove what Raymond did. Enough for families to know the truth."

"Is that better or worse?" Shelly asked. "Knowing their loved ones were recorded begging for their lives?"

No one answered.

The fire burned for hours. The station building collapsed entirely, the tower crushing what remained. By the time dusk settled over the mountains, the compound was rubble and ash and smoke.

Then—headlights on the road. Multiple vehicles.

"They're here," Leon said. "Rangers. Police. Help."

Jack stood on shaking legs. His throat raw from smoke. His hands blistered from something—he couldn't remember what. His mind cycling through everything that had happened. The broadcasts. The basement studio. Raymond's journals. The graves. The confrontation. The fire.

They'd survived.

Park ranger trucks pulled into the compound. Four vehicles. Rangers emerged, saw the burning ruins, saw the five soot-covered people standing in the yard.

"Jack Sullivan?" One ranger called out.

"Yes," Jack said. His voice hoarse.

"We got your emergency broadcast. Multiple agencies heard it. Are you all okay?"

"Physically," Marie said. "The killer is dead. In the fire. But there are thirty-two bodies buried around the compound. Graves marked with wooden markers. Evidence of systematic murder over twenty years."

The rangers' expressions shifted. Horror and grim determination.

"We'll need statements," one said. "Full documentation. This is now a federal crime scene."

"We have evidence," Marie said, indicating the boxes. "Journals. Photographs. Some tape recordings. The killer documented everything."

More vehicles arrived. Police. FCC investigators. A fire truck, though there was nothing left to save. As night fell, the compound filled with lights and activity. Crime scene tape. Excavation equipment being positioned near the graves. Officials taking photographs of the ruins.

Jack sat in the back of a ranger truck, emergency blanket around his shoulders, giving his statement. Describing the contest. The arrival. The discovery of the basement studio. The confrontation. The fire.

All of it felt distant now. Like something that happened to someone else.

"The killer," the ranger asked. "Raymond Peck. You're certain he died in the fire?"

"He chose to die," Jack said. "Lit the fire himself. Stood in the flames rather than let authorities take his tape collection. He believed he was preserving people's voices. That broadcasting them meant they were still alive. The delusion was complete."

The ranger shook his head. "We'll recover remains once the fire cools. Confirm identity. But based on your description and the evidence..." He gestured at the compound. "This is going to be one of the biggest serial killer cases in decades."

They were taken to the hospital in Coopersville. Treated for smoke inhalation, minor burns, shock. Held overnight for observation. The next day, more statements. More questions. FBI agents arrived. The story broke nationally—"Pirate Radio Serial Killer," "The Night Caller Murders," "Voice Preservation Killer Claims 32 Victims."

Through it all, Jack kept thinking about Raymond's last moments. Standing in fire, holding Margaret's tape, speaking to a twenty-one-year-old recording like it was a living person. Choosing death over admitting his delusion.

Radio immortality, Raymond had called it. Voices transmitting forever.

But in the end, all Raymond had achieved was silence. The broadcasts stopped. The tapes burned. The voices destroyed by the man who'd claimed to save them.

And thirty-two graves around a burned transmission tower, finally ready to be excavated, bodies identified, families given closure.

The Night Caller's final broadcast had been screams and smoke and the crash of a falling tower.

No warmth. No comfort. No immortality.

Just ending.

Jack stood outside the hospital, looking at the distant mountains. The compound was twenty-three miles away, but he could still smell smoke. Still hear Raymond's voice in his head—both the broadcaster's warmth and that final, human scream.

They'd survived. Five people who were supposed to become voices on tapes had survived.

But the thirty-two who came before them hadn't.

And Jack knew he'd carry their names for the rest of his life.
