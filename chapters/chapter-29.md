# Chapter 29: Recovered Voices

Jack stood outside the police evidence facility, trying to decide if he should go in.

Families were being offered the opportunity to hear recovered tapes. The dozen reels that had survived the fire. Their loved ones' voices, preserved in Raymond Peck's archive. One final chance to hear them speak.

Some families said yes immediately. Desperate for any connection to people they'd lost years or decades ago. Others refused outright. Didn't want their last memory of a loved one to be terror and pleading.

Jack was there as a witness. In case families had questions about context. About what Raymond had done. About how the recordings came to exist.

But really, he was there because he couldn't stay away.

Inside, the evidence facility was clinical. White walls. Fluorescent lights. Reel-to-reel players on tables, headphones waiting. FBI agents and victim advocates positioned to support families through whatever they were about to hear.

Marie was there too, documenting. Always documenting. She'd attended a dozen of these sessions already, taking notes for her research. Jack didn't know how she could stand it.

The first family arrived. Mrs. Patricia Walsh, mother of Michael Walsh. Michael had disappeared in 1967, fifteen years ago. Presumed runaway. Found two months ago in a grave on Raymond's compound.

She was in her sixties, hands shaking as an FBI agent explained the process. The tape had her son's voice. He'd been twenty-three when Raymond killed him. The recording was eight hours long. She could listen to as much or as little as she wanted.

"I just want to hear him laugh," Mrs. Walsh said. "Michael had the most beautiful laugh. I haven't heard it in fifteen years."

The agent cued the tape to an early section. Before Michael realized what was happening. When Raymond was still pretending to be a friendly radio host, asking about Michael's life.

Michael's voice filled the room through speakers. Young. Alive. Enthusiastic.

"—moved to North Carolina for the job at the factory, you know? Figured I'd make some money, send some home to Mom. She's been struggling since Dad passed. And honestly? It's lonely out here, but The Night Caller helps. Your show makes the nights easier, Mr. Peck."

Mrs. Walsh made a sound like she'd been struck.

"That's him," she whispered. "That's my Michael. That's really him."

She listened, crying, as Michael talked about his life. His job. His plans. His loneliness. His hope that visiting the station meant he was making a real connection, finding a friend in this isolated mountain region.

Then Raymond's voice: "Michael, I want to ask you something. Do you ever think about what happens after we die? About what's left of us?"

Michael: "Sure, I guess. I mean, I'm not religious or anything, but... yeah, sometimes."

Raymond: "What if I told you there was a way to live forever? To never be forgotten? Would you want that?"

Michael: "I mean, yeah. Doesn't everyone?"

The tape continued. Michael getting drowsy. Confused. Raymond's questions becoming more probing. Michael realizing something was wrong.

"Mrs. Walsh," the agent said gently. "It gets difficult from here. Are you sure you want to continue?"

Mrs. Walsh sat frozen, tears streaming down her face. "He was so young. So hopeful. He just wanted..."

She couldn't finish.

"Turn it off," she said finally. "I can't. I can't hear him scared. I can't hear what that monster did to him."

The agent stopped the tape.

Mrs. Walsh sat in silence for a long time. Then: "But he's on there. Michael's voice. He's really on there."

"Yes," the agent confirmed.

"Can I... can I have a copy? Just the early part. Before he knew. When he was just talking about his life. Can I have that?"

The agent looked uncomfortable. "The tapes are evidence. We can't release copies during—"

"Please." Mrs. Walsh's voice broke. "I haven't heard my son's voice in fifteen years. He's on that tape. Alive. Happy. Talking about sending money home to me. Please. I need... I need to have that."

Jack watched the agent's face. Protocol said no. But humanity said something different.

"I'll see what we can do," the agent said quietly.

Mrs. Walsh nodded. Stood. Looked at the tape player like it contained something precious and poisonous simultaneously.

"Thank you," she said. "For finding him. For letting me hear him again. Even if..." She didn't finish. Just left.

Jack and Marie sat outside afterward.

"That's the seventh family I've watched go through this," Marie said. Her clinical documentation voice was gone. Just exhaustion. "Every time it's the same. They want to hear their loved ones. Then they do. And it's a gift and a curse simultaneously. They can't separate the comfort from the horror."

"Was Raymond wrong?" Jack asked. The question had been haunting him since the fire. "About preservation. About voices mattering. She wanted that recording. Needed it. Her son's voice gave her something, even knowing how it came to exist."

Marie was quiet for a long time.

"Raymond was wrong about consent," she finally said. "That's the line. Mrs. Walsh would give anything to have a recording of her son made willingly. A phone call. A birthday message. Anything Michael chose to record. But this? Michael didn't consent to being recorded while dying. Didn't consent to his voice being used in broadcasts. The preservation happened through murder. That's what makes it wrong, no matter how much comfort the tape might provide now."

Jack nodded. But the question lingered. The tapes existed. The voices were preserved. Families could hear loved ones who'd been silent for decades.

Was that worth anything? Could any good come from systematic murder?

Over the next week, Jack watched more families make the choice. Some listened to entire tapes, needing to know everything that happened. Some listened to brief sections, taking what comfort they could before the horror became too much. Some refused entirely, preferring memory to recorded terror.

One woman, Catherine Holcomb—Jennifer's sister—listened to Jennifer's entire eight-hour tape. All of it. The conversation, the drugging, the fear, the pleading, the death. Then she listened to the edited version Raymond had broadcast. Jennifer's voice, cheerful and bright, requesting "Stand By Me."

"I heard this on the radio," Catherine said when the edited version finished. "Four years ago. I was driving and heard Jenny request this song. I called the FCC. Told them my sister had been dead two years, that I'd just heard her voice on a pirate station. They said I was mistaken. Grief-stricken. But I wasn't. It was her. And I was right."

She looked at the tape player.

"Raymond Peck stole her voice. Forced her to broadcast for four years after murdering her. But he was right about one thing—her voice did continue. I heard it. Other people heard it. Jenny's voice reached thousands of listeners, made them feel less alone."

Catherine paused. "Does that make what he did even slightly less evil?"

"No," Jack said.

"Good," Catherine said. "Because for a moment there, I was questioning. Thinking maybe there was something beautiful in it. But there's not. He stole her voice. Used it without permission. That's violation, not preservation."

The FBI catalogued every family interaction. Every tape played. Every reaction.

Some families requested copies for personal use—just the sections before fear and death. Most were denied due to ongoing evidence requirements, but promises were made that eventually, once all appeals and inquiries were complete, edited versions might be released.

Some families requested the tapes be destroyed. Couldn't bear the thought of their loved ones' voices existing in FBI storage, trapped in magnetic coating and plastic reels. Those requests went into official files, to be considered once the case fully closed.

One thing was universal: no family wanted the voices broadcast again. Ever.

The FBI agreed. Once all evidence requirements were met, the tapes would be sealed. Preserved in archives, accessible only to immediate family with court approval. Never to be played publicly. Never to be transmitted over airwaves.

The opposite of Raymond's immortality project.

Not voices broadcasting forever. But voices protected, silent, allowed to rest.

Jack attended the final tape session. David Monroe's family. His parents, older couple from Kentucky. They listened to thirty minutes of David talking about his truck driving job, about the open road, about finding comfort in The Night Caller's broadcasts during lonely midnight hours.

When Raymond's voice turned sinister on the tape, when David started to realize something was wrong, his father stopped the playback.

"That's enough," he said. "We've heard our son. That's all we needed."

His mother was crying. "His voice sounds exactly like I remember. I was afraid I'd forgotten. Afraid when I tried to remember David talking, I'd only hear my own memory of him. But that's really him. His voice. His words. Him."

"Is that a comfort?" Jack asked gently.

She considered. "Yes and no. It's a comfort to hear him. It's torture knowing how that recording came to exist. But I'm glad I heard it. Glad I know he thought about us, wanted to send money home, was trying to find connection in a lonely place. That matters."

She looked at Jack. "You were there. When he died. You found him."

"Yes," Jack said. "Raymond chose to burn rather than let authorities take his tape collection. David's tape survived because we carried evidence boxes out during the fire."

"Thank you," she said. "For saving his voice. Even though it hurts to hear it, even though it's bound up with murder and horror. Thank you."

Jack didn't know how to respond. He'd helped save evidence that was simultaneously comfort and trauma. Gift and curse.

Raymond had been wrong about almost everything. But about voices mattering? About them transmitting meaning across time and death?

Maybe he'd been partially right about that.

Just catastrophically, criminally, unforgivably wrong about the methods.

The tapes were sealed two weeks later. Filed into FBI archives with strict access protocols. Families could request hearings for copies. Researchers could request access with proper clearance. But the voices would never broadcast again.

Never transmitted over airwaves. Never played for strangers. Never used without consent.

Preserved, yes. But in silence. In privacy. With dignity.

The opposite of Raymond's eternal broadcast.

Jack thought about Mrs. Walsh, about Catherine Holcomb, about David Monroe's parents. All of them finding comfort and horror intertwined in magnetic tape.

Raymond had preserved voices. That was true. But preservation without consent was violation. And voices forced to broadcast were voices imprisoned, not freed.

The tapes were sealed. The voices protected. Finally allowed to rest.

That was the only immortality that mattered.
