# Chapter 5: Illegal Transmission

Marie spread her documentation across the bunkhouse table. Two years of research on pirate radio, FCC enforcement patterns, case studies of illegal broadcasters. And now, primary source material from WKNC—Raymond Peck's twenty-year operation.

Except the most important documentation didn't exist.

"Let me explain what we're dealing with," she said. The others gathered around—Jack attentive, Paulie interested, Leon eager, Shelly reluctant. "Pirate radio in the US is a federal crime. Title 47, Section 301 of the Communications Act. You cannot broadcast without FCC authorization."

"We know it's illegal," Shelly said. "That's the whole point. Raymond's fighting corporate radio monopolies, giving voice to—"

"That's not what I mean." Marie pulled out her thesis notes. "I mean the consequences. Unauthorized broadcasting carries fines up to $100,000 per day. Equipment seizure. Criminal charges if you resist. The FCC doesn't negotiate."

Jack leaned forward. "But they haven't shut Raymond down."

"Exactly. That's what makes this so strange." Marie found her enforcement timeline. "Average pirate station life span: six weeks. That's median. Some last days, some months. But all get shut down because the FCC has sophisticated direction-finding equipment. They triangulate signals, send field agents, seize transmitters."

"So how has Raymond lasted twenty years?" Paulie asked.

"Good question. I've been asking it for two years." Marie pulled out another file: her WKNC case study. "I've documented twelve enforcement actions against pirate stations in the Appalachian region since 1975. Every single one resulted in shutdown within three months of first complaint."

She spread them out: dates, locations, outcomes. WKRP Knoxville—shut down in 1976 after six weeks. WXYZ Asheville—shut down in 1978 after four months. A pattern of swift, decisive FCC action.

"But The Night Caller?" Marie tapped her timeline. "First FCC complaint I found was 1964. Twenty years ago. Still broadcasting."

"Maybe the FCC doesn't care," Leon suggested.

"The FCC always cares. Unauthorized broadcasting interferes with licensed stations, emergency services, aviation communications. They have to enforce or the whole system breaks down."

Shelly crossed her arms. "So Raymond's smarter than them. He's evading detection."

"For two decades?" Marie shook her head. "No one's that smart. Not without help or some factor I haven't identified."

Paulie was studying the equipment diagram he'd drawn. "The signal bouncing system I found. That would make triangulation harder, right?"

"Show me."

They went back to the station building, afternoon light slanting through the windows. Paulie led them to the equipment room, pointing out a rack of specialized hardware Marie had photographed but not fully understood.

"This." Paulie indicated a complex assembly of receivers, processors, and relay transmitters. "It receives the broadcast signal, delays it slightly, and retransmits from multiple dummy antennas. Creates false signal sources."

Marie photographed it from multiple angles. "How effective is that?"

"Very. FCC triangulates based on signal direction and strength. This system makes it look like the broadcast is coming from three or four different locations simultaneously." He traced the connections. "Receivers pick up the main transmission, process it, send it to remote antenna arrays—probably hidden in the forest miles from here. FCC tries to triangulate, they get contradictory readings."

"Sophisticated," Marie admitted. "But it requires maintenance. Someone has to check those remote antennas, replace equipment, adjust for changing conditions."

"Raymond," Shelly said. "That's why he's not here. He's out maintaining the system."

But Marie was thinking about the timeline. "Paulie, how long would this system work unattended?"

He considered. "Depends. If everything's solid-state, well-protected from weather, could run months. Maybe a year. But eventually you get failures—connectors corrode, animals chew cables, storms damage antennas. You'd need regular maintenance cycles."

"And Raymond's been here—or not here—for how long based on the food spoilage?"

Jack had taken notes. "Two weeks minimum. Possibly longer."

Two weeks. Marie did the math. Remote antennas exposed to October weather. No maintenance. The signal bouncing system should be degrading, failing. But the broadcast continued pristine, exactly as designed.

"Something's not adding up," she said.

Leon was examining a different rack of equipment. "Hey. Look at this."

They joined him. He pointed to a panel of frequency monitors, currently dark. "Emergency bands. Civil defense, state police, forestry service, aviation. WKNC monitors them—or did. This equipment's been disabled."

"Disabled how?" Marie asked.

"Disconnected. See?" Leon indicated where cables had been removed, carefully coiled and secured nearby. "Someone deliberately took this offline."

"When?"

"Hard to say. Dust pattern suggests weeks, maybe months."

Marie felt the unease deepen. "Why would Raymond disable his emergency monitoring? That's his connection to the outside world, his way of avoiding detection."

"Unless he doesn't want to hear emergency signals," Leon said quietly. "Doesn't want to know if someone's coming."

Shelly laughed, but it sounded forced. "You're being paranoid. Maybe it broke. Maybe he's repairing it."

"The cables are neatly stored," Leon pointed out. "That's not broken. That's deliberate deactivation."

They stood in the silent station, autumn afternoon light painting everything gold. The equipment hummed softly, patient and tireless. But piece by piece, the picture Marie was assembling didn't make sense.

Pirate station operating twenty years. Sophisticated evasion technology. No legal documentation whatsoever. Emergency monitoring disabled. Host absent for weeks.

She'd been researching pirate radio for two years. She knew the patterns, the profiles, the typical operations. Raymond's station fit none of them.

"Let me show you something else," she said.

Back in the bunkhouse, she opened her research files to FCC complaint records. "I filed Freedom of Information requests for all complaints about The Night Caller. Took months to get responses. But look."

She spread them out: twelve complaints spanning 1964 to 1981.

"Complaint one: 1964, Virginia. Listener reports hearing dead husband's voice requesting song on The Night Caller. FCC investigated, couldn't locate signal source, closed case as grief delusion."

"Complaint two: 1966, Tennessee. Mother reports hearing daughter's voice on broadcast. Daughter died in 1965. FCC investigation inconclusive."

"Complaint three: 1969, North Carolina. Man reports hearing brother's voice. Brother died in 1967."

She continued through all twelve. The pattern was consistent: listeners hearing dead relatives' voices on Raymond's show, requesting songs, seeming alive. FCC investigating, finding no evidence, closing cases.

"They thought people were imagining things," Jack said quietly.

"Or grief-stricken," Marie agreed. "The FCC dealt with complaints like this before—people convinced they hear lost loved ones on random broadcasts, pattern-matching voices in static. Happens more than you'd think."

"But what if they really heard them?" Leon asked.

"How? Dead people don't call radio stations."

"Unless their voices are on tape," Paulie said slowly. "Edited into the broadcast. We already know Raymond uses pre-recorded calls."

Marie looked at the complaints again. 1964. 1966. 1969. Spanning years. "That would mean Raymond's been recording and editing fake callers for two decades. Why?"

No answer. Just the implications hanging heavy.

Shelly stood abruptly. "This is insane. You're all turning into paranoid conspiracy theorists. Raymond runs a pirate station. He uses automation. So what? That doesn't make him a—a whatever you're implying."

"I'm not implying anything," Marie said carefully. "I'm presenting documentation."

"You're creating a narrative. Making him sound like a criminal."

"He is a criminal. By definition. Unlicensed broadcasting."

"You know what I mean."

Marie did. They were edging toward something darker than FCC violations, something none of them wanted to articulate. But the facts insisted.

Jack broke the tension. "What do you think we should do?"

Marie considered. As a researcher, the answer was clear: document everything, gather evidence, report to authorities. As someone trapped on a mountain with no phone and no transportation, the answer was more complicated.

"We need to decide tonight," she said. "Before dark. Either we hike out now, while we have light, or we commit to staying until tomorrow morning."

"Hiking out in this weather?" Shelly gestured at the window. Fog had rolled in thicker, visibility maybe fifty yards. Temperature dropping fast.

"It's twenty-three miles on a gravel road," Paulie said. "We'd be hiking in fog, in cold, carrying whatever we can fit in our packs. If we get lost—"

"We can't get lost," Marie countered. "We follow the road."

"If the road stays visible in fog."

Leon pulled out a map. "I've been studying the route. Road switchbacks heavily for the first eight miles, then straightens. If fog's thick and we miss a switchback in the dark, we could walk off into forest and not realize until we're lost."

"So we're trapped," Shelly said with satisfaction. "We have to wait for Raymond."

"We're not trapped," Marie said firmly. "We have options. We can hike out carefully, navigate by compass if needed. Or we stay and gather more information, but we stay smart—locked doors, shifts on watch, prepared to leave at first light."

"Vote again?" Jack suggested.

Marie looked at each of them. Shelly determined to wait for Raymond, her hero worship blinding her to danger signs. Leon enjoying the conspiracy theory vindication, but genuinely worried. Paulie calculating risks pragmatically. Jack trying to mediate, keep them together.

"Here's what I know," Marie said. "This station shouldn't exist. By every metric I've studied, it should've been shut down years ago. Either Raymond Peck is the smartest pirate broadcaster in history, or something else is happening here. Something outside normal parameters."

"Like what?" Shelly demanded.

"I don't know. That's what worries me."

Silence.

Finally, Paulie spoke. "One more night. We document everything tonight, organize evidence, prepare to hike out at first light. If Raymond appears, great. If not, we leave at dawn regardless of weather. Agreed?"

Jack nodded. Leon shrugged acceptance. Marie, after a moment, agreed. It was reasonable, gave them time to gather more evidence for her thesis—for the authorities.

Shelly hesitated, then nodded. "He'll be here tomorrow. You'll see."

But as they split up to prepare—Marie to photograph more documentation, Paulie to map the remaining systems, Jack and Leon to organize supplies for possible hiking—Marie couldn't shake the unease.

Twenty years of successful evasion. Twelve complaints about dead voices. No legal documentation. Equipment maintained but host absent.

She'd come here for her thesis, for primary research on pirate radio operations. She was getting that research. But she was also getting questions that didn't fit any academic framework she knew.

Outside, fog pressed against the windows. The temperature dropped toward freezing. And somewhere in the mountains, Raymond Peck remained absent, his automated broadcast playing on, his station running exactly as designed.

Waiting for something.

Marie just didn't know what.
