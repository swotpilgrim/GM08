# Chapter 26: The Distress Signal

Leon's hands shook as he positioned himself at the emergency frequency equipment. All those years scanning shortwave frequencies in his Cleveland apartment, logging numbers stations broadcasting from who-knows-where, tracking clandestine broadcasts through static and interference—finally, finally all that obsessive knowledge mattered. Everyone had called him paranoid. His coworkers at the factory, his few remaining friends, even his own family. But he'd been preparing for this moment without knowing it.

Emergency band protocol. He knew it by heart. Had memorized it years ago just in case he ever needed it. Channel 9 for CB emergency. 121.5 MHz for aviation distress. 156.8 MHz for maritime emergencies. But park rangers and police monitored multiple frequencies depending on location and jurisdiction. He needed the one that would reach the most agencies simultaneously, the one that would bring help fastest.

Paulie had bypassed the mercury switch, disarmed the fire trap. The equipment was safe to use. Theoretically. If Paulie's hurried rewiring was correct. If Raymond hadn't installed backup traps they hadn't found.

Leon took a breath. Flipped the emergency override.

No electrocution. No explosion. Just the hum of the transmitter shifting frequencies, abandoning Raymond's pirate station broadcast to access official emergency channels.

The feedback whine screamed through the building. Jack's emergency broadcast was still going out on the regular frequency. Now Leon would add the official SOS.

He keyed the microphone. His voice had to be clear, precise. No rambling. No tangents. The pattern-recognition skills that made people call him paranoid—those had to become laser focus now.

"Emergency. This is Leon Kowalski broadcasting on emergency frequency from illegal radio station WKNC, Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina." He read the coordinates Paulie had calculated. "Latitude thirty-five point seven-six-three-nine. Longitude eighty-two point eight-one-five-two. Requesting immediate law enforcement and park ranger assistance."

His voice steadied as he spoke. This was what he'd trained for without knowing it. All those nights scanning frequencies, decoding transmissions, logging patterns. This was the pattern that mattered.

"Nature of emergency: active serial killer on site. Raymond Peck, age fifty-eight, operator of this illegal station. Responsible for minimum thirty-two murders between 1963 and present. Evidence includes extensive tape library documenting victims, burial sites around transmission tower, written confession in journals."

Through the window, Leon could see the chaos. Raymond swinging the axe at Jack's booth. Paulie frantically rewiring the transmitter. Marie and Shelly with evidence boxes. The whole compound in motion.

"Five civilians currently held against will," Leon continued. "Killer is armed. Has expressed intent to preserve victims by recording voices before murder. Immediate assistance required."

He released the microphone key. Waited. Emergency protocols required acknowledgment. Someone had to respond.

Static hissed. Then—

"This is Park Ranger Station 7, Pisgah National Forest. We copy your distress call. Repeat coordinates."

Leon nearly sobbed with relief. He repeated the coordinates, added terrain details. Single logging road access, treacherous in current weather, twenty-three miles from nearest town.

"Acknowledged. Dispatching ranger units and coordinating with county sheriffs. ETA approximately ninety minutes given road conditions. Can you confirm killer's current location?"

Leon looked through the window. Raymond had abandoned Jack's booth, was grappling with someone—Leon had been so focused on the broadcast he'd lost track.

"Killer is inside main station building. Currently attempting to stop us from broadcasting this SOS. We have evidence secured but situation is volatile."

"Understood. Stay on this frequency. Keep line open. Help is en route."

Ninety minutes. Help was coming. Leon had done it. The conspiracy theorist, the paranoid ham radio operator who everyone dismissed—he'd just broadcast an SOS that would bring rangers and police and end Raymond's twenty-year killing spree.

He turned from the equipment, planning to signal the others that help was confirmed. Instead he found Raymond standing three feet away, breathing hard from the struggle with someone—had it been him? Leon couldn't remember now. The adrenaline had made everything blur.

"You've destroyed it," Raymond said. His voice was hollow. Dead. "Twenty years of work. The most extensive preservation project in human history. And you've called authorities to destroy it."

"You murdered thirty-two people," Leon said. "What did you expect?"

"I saved them," Raymond said. But there was no conviction in his voice anymore. Just... exhaustion. "I gave them immortality through broadcast. Their voices reaching thousands of listeners. Mattering. Continuing. That's salvation."

"That's delusion," Leon said. "I've spent my whole life looking for patterns in radio signals. Numbers stations, coded transmissions, clandestine broadcasts. I know what real signals look like versus noise. And your broadcasts? They're just noise, Raymond. Dead voices forced to transmit. No consciousness. No immortality. Just recordings."

Raymond's face crumpled. "You understand patterns. You see connections others miss. How can you not see this? The pattern of voices echoing through time, preserved in electromagnetic waves, transmitted across distance and death itself. That's the most beautiful pattern humans have ever created."

"It's murder with extra steps," Leon said. "That's the only pattern here."

Through the window, Leon saw the ranger acknowledgment light blinking. Ninety minutes. They just had to survive ninety minutes.

Raymond saw it too. "They're coming. To arrest me. To destroy the tapes. To silence everyone I've saved."

"To bring justice," Leon said.

"To end immortality," Raymond corrected. He looked around the station—the equipment, the broadcast booth, the tower visible through windows. His whole life concentrated in this compound. "I can't let that happen."

He turned and walked toward the basement stairs. Not running. Just... purposeful. Deliberate.

Leon's paranoia screamed warnings. "What are you doing?"

"If I can't preserve you," Raymond said, descending the stairs, "then I'll preserve the work itself. The tapes. The recordings. The evidence of what I've achieved. It will all burn before authorities can take it."

Leon lunged for the stairs, but Raymond was already down. Moving through the basement toward the tape library. Leon heard scraping—the kerosene can being dragged across concrete.

"No!" Leon shouted. "Paulie! Marie! He's going for the kerosene!"

But the feedback whine was so loud, and everyone was scattered throughout the compound dealing with their own crises. Leon ran down the basement stairs, hand on the railing, feet pounding.

The basement studio was exactly as they'd found it days ago. Walls lined with reel-to-reel tapes. Hundreds of them. Twenty years of systematic recording. Names and dates on labels. Margaret Peck's tape in its glass case prominently displayed.

And Raymond in the center, splashing kerosene over everything.

"Don't," Leon said. "Raymond, that's evidence. Families need that. They need to know what happened to their loved ones."

"They need to know their loved ones mattered," Raymond said. He was crying now, tears running down his face behind his bifocals. "That they didn't just disappear into nothing. I gave them that. I preserved them. And you're trying to take it away."

"We're trying to give families closure," Leon said.

"Closure is death," Raymond said. "Silence. Forgetting. The opposite of preservation." He pulled out matches. "Better to end it all on my terms than let authorities destroy it piece by piece. Better to burn than fade."

Leon looked at the tapes. Thirty-two victims. Hundreds of hours of recording. The only evidence of Raymond's systematic methodology. If it burned, they'd have graves and journals, but not the voices themselves. Not proof of what Raymond did to his victims before killing them.

"The rangers are ninety minutes away," Leon said. "You don't have to do this. You could surrender. Explain your philosophy to them. Make them understand—"

"No one understands," Raymond said flatly. "I've tried for twenty years to make people see that radio is immortality. That voices transmitted defeat death. No one sees it. They see murder. They see delusion. They don't see the beautiful pattern."

He struck a match.

"Margaret would understand," Raymond continued. "She's here, in these tapes. When I burn them, she'll be free. We'll both be free. All thirty-seven of us—thirty-two victims, the five of you, and me. We'll all burn together. Transform through fire instead of radio."

The match flame reflected in his glasses. In the glass case containing Margaret's tape. In twenty-one years of grief turned to systematic murder.

"Don't make me your thirty-third victim," Leon said. "I called for help. They're coming. You can still choose how this ends."

"I've already chosen," Raymond said.

He dropped the match into the kerosene-soaked tape library.

And Leon realized with absolute certainty that his pattern-recognition skills, his paranoid preparation, his successful SOS broadcast—none of it would matter if they all burned before the rangers arrived.

Ninety minutes was too long.

The fire caught immediately, kerosene igniting with a whoosh that filled the basement with heat and light. Tapes began to burn, magnetic coating curling and blackening, voices destroyed by the flames that were supposed to preserve.

Raymond stood in the center of his burning life's work, cradling Margaret's tape case, watching twenty years of preservation consumed by fire.

And Leon ran for the stairs, shouting for everyone to evacuate, knowing they had minutes before the whole building went up.

The race against ninety minutes had become a race against fire.
