# Chapter 12: The FCC Complaints

They were two miles from the compound when the weather turned.

Marie felt the first drops of freezing rain against her face, cold enough to sting. Within minutes, it intensified—sleet mixing with rain, turning the gravel road slick.

"We need to keep moving," she said, pulling her jacket hood up.

"In this?" Shelly's voice was tight with fear. "We'll slip, break an ankle, freeze."

"Or we stay and Raymond finds us," Leon countered.

But Paulie was examining the road ahead, where it curved sharply downhill. "Look at that grade. Ice is forming already. If we try to navigate that in the dark, in freezing rain, someone's going over the edge."

Marie wanted to argue, but she'd spent enough time in mountains to know he was right. The road switchbacked down the mountain for miles. One slip on ice, one wrong step in limited visibility, and they'd tumble into forest ravines.

"Back to the compound," Jack said quietly. "We hole up, wait for morning. Weather should clear."

"Or worsen," Leon pointed out.

"Either way, we'll have light to navigate by. Better odds than this."

They turned back, defeated. Marie felt the frustration like physical weight. So close to escape, forced to return to the place they'd been desperate to leave.

The compound looked different in sleet and growing darkness. More sinister. The tower's red lights blinked through the precipitation, lonely warnings in the storm.

They took shelter in the bunkhouse, dripping wet, shivering. Paulie got the wood stove going while Marie stripped off her soaked jacket and tried to salvage her camera. Four rolls of film, three exposed, one partial. Evidence that had to survive.

She wrapped the camera carefully in dry clothing, secured it in her bag. If nothing else survived this weekend, that film had to.

"We need a plan," Jack said, rubbing his hands near the stove. "Weather clears tomorrow morning, we leave immediately. But tonight—"

"We lock ourselves in," Paulie finished. "Shifts on watch. Two people awake at all times."

"What if Raymond comes?" Shelly asked.

"We hear him, we run," Leon said. "Storm or not. Into the woods if we have to."

Marie pulled out her research files, trying to occupy her mind. They were stuck here until morning. Might as well use the time.

She spread the FCC complaints across the table, documents she'd fought two years to obtain through FOIA requests. Twelve complaints about The Night Caller, spanning 1964 to 1981. She'd read them before, filed them away as curiosities.

Now, with victim names from the basement, she could cross-reference properly.

First complaint, dated February 1964: Clara Hendricks, reporting that she heard her brother Thomas's voice on an illegal radio broadcast. Thomas had died November 1963. The complaint described hearing Thomas request "Blue Moon," say he missed his family, speak directly to Clara using a pet name only they knew.

FCC investigation: Field agents attempted to locate signal source, unsuccessful due to signal bouncing. Dismissed complaint as grief-induced audio pareidolia—hearing familiar voices in random sounds.

But Marie had seen Thomas Hendricks' tape in the basement. November 1963. He hadn't been randomly remembered—he'd been murdered and preserved.

Second complaint, October 1966: Richard Martinez, reporting hearing his sister Angela's voice on the same pirate station. Angela died in a car accident March 1966. The complaint was detailed—specific song requests, phrases Angela used, her distinctive laugh.

FCC investigation: No signal source located. Complaint dismissed.

Angela Martinez's tape: March 1971. Wait—that date was wrong. Marie rechecked. The complaint said Angela died in 1966, but Raymond's tape was labeled 1971.

She pulled out her newspaper archives, searching. Found Angela Martinez's obituary: March 1971, age 29, suspicious circumstances. Not 1966.

The complaint had been filed five years before Angela died.

Marie's hands shook as she reread it. Richard Martinez heard his sister's voice in 1966. But Angela didn't die until 1971.

That meant...

"Oh God," she whispered.

"What?" Jack leaned over.

Marie showed him. "This complaint. Filed in 1966, reporting a dead sister. But she didn't die until 1971."

"Could be a different Angela Martinez," Paulie suggested.

"Same town. Same age range. Same station." Marie shook her head. "It's her. Which means Raymond recorded her before 1966. Kept the recording. And the brother somehow heard it."

"Then why did the FCC dismiss it?"

"Because when they investigated, Angela was still alive. So they thought the brother was mistaken or lying."

"And five years later..." Leon said slowly.

"Five years later, Raymond killed her." Marie felt sick. "He recorded her years before her death. Kept the recording. Used it occasionally on broadcasts. Her brother heard it once, filed a complaint, but it was dismissed because Angela was alive at the time. Then Raymond finally 'preserved' her permanently in 1971."

They sat in horrified silence.

Marie went through the other complaints with new understanding. Some victims died shortly before complaints—families hearing voices within months of deaths. But others...

Jennifer Holcomb: Complaint filed by mother in 1976. Jennifer died 1978. Two-year gap.

Michael Chen: Complaint filed by father in 1973. Michael died 1975. Two-year gap.

Raymond had been recording potential victims for years before killing them. Building his library gradually. Test recordings. Practice sessions. Voice samples.

And when families heard those recordings on broadcasts—heard their living relatives speaking as if from beyond death—they filed complaints that were dismissed.

"The FCC could have stopped this," Marie said bitterly. "If they'd investigated properly, if they'd taken the complaints seriously..."

"They had no reason to," Jack said quietly. "Dead people on the radio sounds like grief delusion. Especially when some of those people were still alive."

"But twelve complaints. Twelve families saying the same thing. That should have triggered pattern analysis."

"Probably did," Paulie said. "And the pattern was: pirate station, signal bouncing, location unknown, families upset. Standard nuisance case. Not worth major resources."

Marie knew he was right. FCC handled hundreds of pirate radio cases annually. Most were hobbyists, college students, people running unlicensed stations from basements. Resources focused on stopping interference with licensed broadcasts, not investigating every emotional complaint from grieving families.

But still. Twelve chances to catch Raymond. Twelve families ignored.

She documented the cross-references—victim names, complaint dates, death dates, the gaps revealing Raymond's long-term planning. Evidence of a pattern authorities should have seen.

Outside, sleet continued. The compound sat isolated by weather and darkness. And somewhere in the mountains, Raymond remained absent.

"Where is he?" Shelly asked. She'd been quiet since they returned, processing. "If he planned all this, invited us here, why isn't he here?"

"Waiting," Leon said. "Letting us discover everything. Psychologically wearing us down."

"Or genuinely delayed," Marie offered, though she didn't believe it. "Emergency, like his message said."

"Bullshit," Paulie said. "Everything was planned. Cut phone line, sabotaged van, automated broadcast. He knew exactly when we'd arrive and set everything up in advance."

"Then why not be here?" Shelly pressed.

No one had an answer.

Marie returned to the complaints, reading more carefully. One caught her attention, dated 1979, filed by someone named Eleanor Peck.

Peck. Raymond's surname.

The complaint was different from others—not reporting dead relatives but claiming illegal use of copyrighted material. Specifically, a recording of Margaret Peck's voice used without estate permission.

Eleanor Peck, filing as executor of Margaret's estate, demanded The Night Caller cease using Margaret's voice on broadcasts.

FCC response: Unable to locate station to serve cease-and-desist. Case closed.

But the complaint included a detail Marie had missed before: Eleanor was Raymond's sister. And she specified that Margaret's death was 1961, but recordings of her voice had appeared on The Night Caller broadcasts continuously since 1962.

Raymond's first preserved voice. His wife. The one that started everything.

And his own family had complained about it. Asked him to stop. Been ignored.

Marie photographed the complaint, adding it to her evidence collection.

"We have everything we need," she said finally. "Victim tapes, burial locations, photos, FCC complaints, patterns spanning twenty years. When we reach authorities tomorrow, they'll have no choice but to act."

"If we reach them," Shelly said quietly.

"We will." Marie refused to consider alternatives. They had evidence. They had truth. They just needed to survive until morning.

Jack organized watch shifts: he and Marie first, then Paulie and Leon, then back to Jack and Shelly at dawn. Simple rotation.

As the others tried to sleep, Marie sat by the window, watching the compound through sleet. The station building dark except for equipment lights. The tower blinking its patient rhythm. Everything waiting.

She thought about the twelve complaints. Twelve families who knew something was wrong, tried to report it, were dismissed. How many victims could have been saved if someone had listened?

Thomas Hendricks in 1964. Angela Martinez before 1971. Jennifer Holcomb before 1978.

Pattern recognition wasn't just academic exercise. It saved lives. Or should have.

"You okay?" Jack asked quietly.

"No. I keep thinking about the families. They knew. They reported it. And nobody listened."

"You're listening now. Documenting it. Making sure it's recorded properly."

"After fifty-three people died."

"Better late than never. The pattern you found—that will change how the FCC handles similar complaints. You're creating precedent."

Marie hadn't thought of it that way. Her thesis on pirate radio would become a case study in law enforcement failure. Evidence-based policy recommendations. System improvements.

Cold comfort for the dead. But maybe prevention for the future.

Outside, the storm intensified. Inside, Marie kept watch, camera bag close, evidence secured.

One night. Just survive one night.

Then light, and escape, and justice.

Finally.
