# Chapter 14: Missing Persons Correlation

They ran.

Out of the station building, across the icy compound, back to the bunkhouse. The shadow they'd seen near the tree line was gone—if it had ever been there. But paranoia drove them now, fear that Raymond was close, watching, waiting.

Inside the bunkhouse, they barricaded the door with the table and a heavy shelf. Paulie checked windows while Leon searched for more hidden microphones. Jack's hands shook as he helped, adrenaline making everything sharp and immediate.

"Did you actually see someone?" Marie asked, breathing hard.

"I saw movement," Jack said. "Could've been deer, or trees in wind, or..."

"Or Raymond," Shelly finished.

They fell silent, listening. Outside: wind, ice cracking on tree branches, the generator's distant hum. No footsteps. No voices. But absence of sound didn't mean absence of threat.

"We need to organize what we know," Marie said finally. "Evidence, timeline, everything. Get it straight before we leave tomorrow."

"Why?" Leon asked. "We have the photos, the files. That's enough."

"Is it?" Marie pulled out her documentation. "We have pieces. We need the complete picture. Otherwise authorities might dismiss parts of it, find gaps, question our conclusions."

Jack understood. They couldn't just show up with wild stories and grainy photos. They needed organized, comprehensive evidence. Case files that proved every claim.

"I'll build the timeline," he said. "Cross-reference everything."

Marie spread her newspaper archives across the floor—two years of collected obituaries, missing persons cases, local news from three states. Leon had his Night Caller logs. Marie her FCC complaints. Jack his notes from the contest forms and Raymond's desk.

They worked through the early morning hours, building the picture piece by piece.

Jack started with the victim names from the basement tapes. Fifty-three total, spanning 1963 to 1982. He wrote each name on separate paper, organizing chronologically.

Then he cross-referenced with Marie's missing persons files.

The pattern emerged immediately.

Thomas Hendricks, 1963: Missing person report filed by brother in November 1963. Last seen "visiting a radio station in the mountains" according to witness statement. Body never found. Case went cold.

Angela Martinez, 1971: Missing person report filed by family in March 1971. Last known activity: told sister she won a contest to visit her favorite radio show. Never returned. Case unsolved.

Jennifer Holcomb, 1978: Missing person report filed by mother in March 1978. Last contact: excited phone call about visiting The Night Caller. Disappeared en route. Case cold.

On and on. Thirty-one of the fifty-three victims had missing persons reports filed. The pattern was consistent: victims told someone they were visiting a radio station, or meeting someone from a broadcast, or winning a contest. Then vanished.

But the reports never connected to The Night Caller specifically. Most victims didn't name the station—just said "radio show" or "broadcasting contest." And with the station being pirate, illegal, unlicensed, there was no official entity to investigate.

"Different jurisdictions," Marie noted, reading over his shoulder. "Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina. Three states, dozens of counties. Nobody saw the pattern because nobody was looking across borders."

"And the victims were isolated," Jack added, reading the files. "Estranged from families, living alone, transient workers. People whose disappearances didn't trigger intensive investigations."

Thomas Hendricks: divorced, lived alone, limited contact with family.

Angela Martinez: college dropout, worked irregular hours, rented room month-to-month.

Michael Chen: no local family, few friends, kept to himself.

Raymond selected carefully. People who existed on society's margins. Lonely enough to seek connection through radio, isolated enough that their absence wasn't immediately alarming.

"Twenty-two victims have no missing persons reports at all," Jack said, reviewing the numbers. "No one reported them missing."

"Because no one noticed," Leon said quietly. "No family checking in, no employer wondering, no friends concerned. They just... disappeared."

The loneliest victims. People so disconnected that their absence from the world went unremarked.

Jack thought about his own application, where he'd mentioned minimal family contact. Raymond's note: "Would be missed eventually but timeline allows 2-3 weeks."

Two to three weeks for someone to realize Jack Sullivan hadn't shown up for his radio shift, hadn't answered calls, was genuinely gone. By which time Raymond would have recorded him, preserved him, buried him.

Another unmarked disappearance.

He forced the thought away, focused on the documentation. Emotion later. Evidence now.

"Timeline," he said, writing it out.

1963: First murder (Thomas Hendricks). Missing person report filed, never solved.

1964-1965: Three more victims. Two missing person reports, one unreported disappearance.

1966-1967: No murders. Gap in activity.

1968-1969: Two victims. One missing person report.

The pattern continued through two decades. Clusters of murders followed by gaps. Fall and winter months heavily represented. Victims from across three states but concentrated within radio broadcast range.

"He hunted his listening area," Marie observed. "Stayed within The Night Caller's signal reach. Probably contacted victims through the show itself—offering contests, invitations, special guest opportunities."

"Like us," Shelly said. She'd been quiet, processing. "The contest was broadcast, what, three times?"

"Three times," Leon confirmed, checking his logs. "September 15th, 22nd, and 29th. Then the deadline."

"Limited exposure," Marie said. "Deliberate. Enough to seem real but not enough to generate large applicant pool or media attention."

Jack pulled out the contest materials from Raymond's desk. Forty-seven total applicants. Most from within The Night Caller's primary broadcast area—western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia.

Demographics varied but commonalities emerged: lonely, isolated, devoted listeners. People seeking connection.

Perfect victims.

"We need to document how he contacted them," Jack said. "Prove the pattern of invitations leading to disappearances."

They dug through materials, found more evidence in Raymond's meticulous records. Saved letters from victims, excited about visits. Correspondence arranging meetings. Phone numbers logged with notes about conversations.

Raymond cultivated relationships before murders. Weeks or months of contact, building trust, ensuring victims came willingly.

"Premeditation," Marie said, photographing the letters. "Systematic stalking and selection. This isn't impulsive killing. This is organized, careful predation."

"For twenty years," Paulie added. "How did no one notice?"

But Jack understood. Pirate radio operated outside official systems. Victims came from different jurisdictions. Reports weren't connected. And Raymond was patient, careful, smart.

One victim every few months. Space them out. Vary the method of contact. Keep detailed records hidden.

A perfect predator.

"Authorities need to search the graves," Marie said. "Recover all fifty-three bodies. Identify them, notify families, give them closure."

Jack marked the burial locations on Raymond's hand-drawn map. Fifty-three graves around the compound, each carefully noted. Markers would be visible if you knew where to look.

Evidence waiting to be discovered.

"We should hide copies of this," Leon suggested. "In case Raymond destroys the station before authorities arrive."

"Good idea," Marie agreed. She separated documentation into three sets: one for her camera bag, one for Jack's pack, one to hide.

They waterproofed the third set in plastic bags, then Leon and Paulie braved the cold to bury it in the woods beyond the compound fence. Insurance against Raymond erasing evidence.

While they worked, Jack organized the final summary:

**RAYMOND PECK - EVIDENCE SUMMARY**

- Fifty-three confirmed victims, 1963-1982
- Thirty-one missing persons reports, never connected
- Twenty-two unreported disappearances
- Systematic selection of isolated, lonely individuals
- Contact through The Night Caller pirate broadcast
- Invitations to visit station under contest/guest pretenses
- Victims disappeared after visiting compound
- Bodies buried around station compound, locations documented
- Voice recordings preserved in basement studio
- Ongoing use of victim voices in broadcasts
- Multiple FCC complaints dismissed
- Pattern of criminal activity spanning three states, twenty years

"This is airtight," Marie said, reviewing Jack's summary. "Any investigator reading this will have everything needed for prosecution."

"If Raymond doesn't destroy it," Shelly said.

"He won't," Jack said with more confidence than he felt. "We're leaving at dawn. Getting this to authorities. Raymond can't stop all of us."

But even as he said it, he wondered. They were five people trapped on a mountain with a killer who'd successfully evaded detection for twenty years. A man smart enough to build an automated broadcast system, careful enough to document everything, patient enough to kill dozens without getting caught.

Were they really going to just walk away?

"First light," Paulie said, returning from burying the evidence. "We stick together, move fast, don't stop until we reach Coopersville."

"And if Raymond tries to stop us?" Leon asked.

"We run," Marie said simply. "No heroics. We run and we get help."

Jack nodded agreement. They weren't equipped to fight. Their job was to survive, to escape, to deliver evidence.

Justice, not vengeance.

Outside, the sky was lightening—not quite dawn but close. They'd worked through the night, organizing twenty years of horror into comprehensible documentation.

Now they just had to survive long enough to use it.

Jack packed his evidence carefully, double-checked supplies, prepared for the hike out.

Twenty-three miles. Six to seven hours. By early afternoon they'd reach Coopersville, find authorities, end Raymond's decades of murder.

Simple plan.

But as dawn broke over the mountain, as the compound emerged from darkness into gray morning light, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that Raymond had been planning too.

That they'd organized evidence and escape routes while being watched, heard, studied.

That Raymond, after twenty years of perfect execution, wouldn't let his collection be discovered without one final performance.

One last preservation.

And looking at his friends—Marie determined, Paulie practical, Leon nervous, Shelly scared—Jack realized they were exactly what Raymond had wanted.

Perfect voices.

For the eternal broadcast.
