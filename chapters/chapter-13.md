# Chapter 13: The Contest Trap

Jack couldn't sleep.

He sat by the bunkhouse window during his watch shift with Marie, staring at the dark compound. Sleet had stopped, leaving everything coated in ice. The station building gleamed in the tower's blinking lights, frozen and waiting.

His mind kept circling back to one question: Why had Raymond invited them?

Fifty-three victims over twenty years. Raymond had a system, a process. He identified targets, lured them in, recorded them, preserved them. But those were individual invitations—one person at a time, careful selection, manageable risk.

Five people simultaneously was different. More dangerous. Harder to control.

So why?

"What are you thinking?" Marie asked quietly.

"The contest. Why invite five people at once? Why us specifically?"

Marie considered. "Sample variety? Different voices, different personalities. More material for broadcasts."

"Maybe. But it's risky. Five people are more likely to resist, to figure things out, to escape."

"We did figure it out," Marie pointed out.

"Exactly. So either Raymond underestimated us, or..."

"Or what?"

"Or he wanted us to figure it out." Jack turned the idea over. "Think about it. Hidden microphones. Automated broadcasts clearly meant to be discovered. The basement accessible if you looked carefully. Everything documented and preserved like he wanted it found."

"You're saying he wanted us to discover his collection?"

"I don't know. Maybe. Or maybe I'm seeing patterns that aren't there."

But the thought nagged at him. Raymond had been meticulous for twenty years. Careful. Precise. And then suddenly invited five contest winners to an isolated compound with obvious evidence everywhere?

It didn't fit.

"I'm going to check something," he said.

"Now? It's 2 AM."

"Can't sleep anyway."

Marie grabbed her jacket. "Then I'm coming. We stick together, remember?"

They woke Paulie and Leon, explained. The four of them crossed the icy compound to the station building. The door was still unlocked—Raymond had never secured it against them. Another strange choice.

Inside, Jack went straight to Raymond's living quarters. The monk's cell with minimal furnishings and Margaret's photo.

And the desk.

Jack had seen it during their earlier search but hadn't examined it closely. Now he pulled open drawers systematically, looking for anything that explained the contest.

Third drawer down: a file folder labeled "Contest Selections, October 1982."

Jack's hands shook as he opened it.

Inside: their contest entry forms. All five. The ones they'd mailed weeks ago, hoping to win a weekend at the legendary pirate station.

But these weren't just filed forms. They were annotated.

Jack's entry form had notes in Raymond's precise handwriting, written in the margins and on a separate evaluation sheet clipped to the application:

"Jack Sullivan, age 23, University of New Hampshire. College radio DJ, overnight shift 'The Graveyard Slot.' Application essay demonstrates genuine understanding of radio intimacy—discusses loneliness, connection through airwaves, voice as comfort in darkness. Mentions losing father at 16, using radio to cope. Excellent candidate with emotional depth.

VOICE ANALYSIS: Warm baritone, trained mic technique, natural pacing. Good emotional range, authentic delivery. Similar to Thomas Hendricks but younger, more contemporary. Would broadcast exceptionally well. Strong empathy comes through in tone.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE: Empathetic, introspective, seeks meaning in radio beyond entertainment. Admires The Night Caller specifically—mentions show as primary inspiration for pursuing broadcasting. Perfect susceptibility to trust. Likely to see best in people, delay defensive reactions.

RISK ASSESSMENT: Low. College student, working class background, few close connections mentioned in essay. Mother in New Hampshire but relationship distant per application. Would be missed by university radio station eventually but timeline allows 2-3 weeks before serious investigation initiated.

SELECTION: APPROVED. Primary target for emotional/intimate vocal samples. Excellent foundation voice for collection."

Jack felt cold that had nothing to do with October weather. Raymond had evaluated him like a specimen. Analyzed his voice, his psychology, his vulnerability.

Selected him for harvest.

He read the others' evaluations:

Marie's form: "Skeptical, analytical, challenging personality. VOICE: Precise, educated, slightly sharp. Adds variety to collection. RISK: Higher—graduate student, family connections, research-focused. But intellectual arrogance may delay escape attempts. APPROVED for contrasting vocal qualities."

Paulie's: "Sound engineer, appreciates technical craft. VOICE: Calm, factual, measured tones. Technical vocabulary valuable. RISK: Low. Works freelance, lives alone, no dependents. APPROVED for professional/technical samples."

Leon's: "Conspiracy theorist, paranoid but isolated. VOICE: Distinctive, nervous energy, rapid speech patterns. Interesting perspective. RISK: Very low—no close connections, history of being dismissed. Perfect victim. APPROVED."

Shelly's evaluation was longest: "Devoted superfan, calls weekly, lonely. VOICE: Beautiful soprano, emotional range, genuine warmth. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE: Parasocial attachment to show, seeks connection, vulnerable to manipulation. Perfect victim—trusting, emotionally dependent on The Night Caller, unlikely to resist.  RISK: Minimal. Lives with mother, limited social network, no career commitments. APPROVED. Primary target for emotional/vulnerable vocal samples."

Jack felt sick reading them. Raymond had profiled each of them. Identified their weaknesses, their isolation, their susceptibility. Selected them not randomly but deliberately.

A curated collection.

"Oh God," Marie said, reading over his shoulder. "He chose us. Specifically."

"Yeah." Jack found more notes—drafts of the contest announcement, designed to appeal to their specific demographics. Questions crafted to reveal vulnerability, isolation, devotion to radio.

A trap baited precisely for them.

"The contest was only advertised three times," Leon said, reading through materials. "Just enough to seem real, but not enough to draw major attention. And look—" He showed them a list. "Forty-seven entries total. Raymond selected the five he wanted and destroyed the rest."

Forty-seven people had applied. Forty-two got rejection letters. Five got invitations to their deaths.

"We need to leave," Paulie said. "Right now. Ice or no ice."

"Wait." Leon was examining the desk more carefully. "If Raymond planned all this, documented everything, why leave it where we'd find it?"

"Maybe he thought we wouldn't search his quarters," Marie suggested.

"Or maybe," Jack said slowly, "he wanted us to find it."

Leon pulled open another drawer. Found something. "Jack. Look at this."

A technical manual. "Compound Audio Monitoring System - Installation and Operation."

Leon flipped it open. Diagrams showed microphone placements throughout the compound. Bunkhouse, station building, generator shed, even outdoor areas near the tower.

Everything wired to recording equipment in the basement.

"He's been listening," Leon breathed. "The whole time. Every conversation, every plan, every word we've said."

Jack thought about the past two days. Their discussions in the bunkhouse. Their theories. Their plans. Their fears.

Raymond heard all of it.

"The hidden microphones we found," Marie said. "Those were obvious. Deliberately visible. To make us feel like we'd found them all."

"But there are more," Paulie finished. "Concealed better. Professional installation."

Leon was tracing through the manual. "Look at the coverage. Every room, multiple mics for redundancy. And it all feeds to—"

He stopped, face going pale.

"To what?" Jack asked.

"To the broadcast automation system. Real-time sampling. Raymond could take our voices from these recordings, edit them, integrate them into broadcasts." Leon looked up. "We've been providing him with audio samples since we arrived. Hours of it. He already has everything he needs."

The implication hit Jack like cold water. Raymond didn't need to drug them, restrain them, force cooperation. He'd been recording them naturally, capturing authentic emotions, genuine reactions.

Fear. Confusion. Determination. All the vocal variety Raymond needed.

"The whole weekend was a recording session," Marie said. "We walked into a studio and performed for him without knowing it."

Jack thought about his radio voice, the careful control he used on broadcasts. Had he used it here? Or had he been himself, unguarded, providing Raymond with authentic vulnerable samples?

"He's been editing already," Leon said, finding more notes. "Look. 'Jack - 47 min usable audio, emotional range excellent, integrate by November.' That's days away. He's planning to use us on broadcasts before we even—"

Before we're dead, Jack finished mentally.

"Where is he?" Shelly's voice came from the doorway. She'd followed them, listening. "If he's monitoring us, recording us, editing us—where is he?"

They looked at each other. Good question. If Raymond was actively using their voices, editing them for broadcast, he needed to be accessing the equipment.

Which meant he was close.

Jack moved to the window, looking out at the compound. Everything appeared empty. But appearances meant nothing.

"He could be in the basement," Paulie said. "Listening right now."

"Or in the woods," Leon suggested. "Watching through the fence."

"Or," Marie said quietly, "he's been here the whole time. In a space we haven't found."

They'd searched the station building. Found the basement, the recording studio, the tape library. But maybe they'd missed something. Another hidden room. A second concealed space.

"We search again," Jack decided. "Every wall, every floor. Find where Raymond's hiding."

"Or we run," Shelly said. "Ice be damned. We run right now."

Jack looked at her. For once, her fear wasn't denial. It was legitimate survival instinct.

But outside, through the window, he saw movement. Just a shadow, brief and distant. Near the tree line.

"Too late," he said quietly.

The others looked. Saw it too.

Someone was out there.

Watching.

Waiting.

And Jack realized with cold certainty: Raymond had never left. He'd been here all along, observing their discovery, listening to their plans, letting them find just enough to be terrified.

Collecting their fear.

Recording their voices.

Preparing the final preservation.
