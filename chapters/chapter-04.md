# Chapter 4: Search the Station

Morning came cold and gray, fog thick in the valleys below.

Jack woke to find Shelly already up, making instant coffee on the wood stove. She looked tired but determined, her hair pulled back, makeup carefully applied despite the early hour.

"Morning," she said brightly. "Sleep okay?"

"Not really." Jack accepted the mug she offered. Weak coffee, but hot. "You?"

"Fine. Raymond will be here soon. He said morning." She glanced at her watch. "It's almost eight."

Marie emerged from her bunk, followed by Paulie and Leon. They'd all slept maybe three hours after returning from the station. Leon's eyes were red-rimmed, his notebook still clutched in one hand.

"We should search the compound properly," Marie said, pulling on her jacket. "Daylight. Methodical. Document everything."

"For what?" Shelly asked.

"For understanding what's going on here."

"Raymond's coming back. He said—"

"Shelly." Marie's voice was gentle but firm. "We watched an automated broadcast all night. No one was there. We need to know more."

Shelly's jaw tightened, but she didn't argue.

They split up after breakfast. Marie took the station building with her camera and notebook. Paulie mapped the electrical system. Leon wanted the tower. Jack searched for anything they'd missed, any sign of Raymond.

Shelly stayed in the bunkhouse, pointedly not participating.

Jack started with the perimeter. The chain-link fence enclosed maybe two acres. He walked it, looking for gaps or gates. The main gate they'd driven through was still open. No other exits. The fence was in good repair—posts solid, wire taut. Recent maintenance.

At the back of the compound, where the forest pressed closest, he found something: a trail. Narrow, barely visible, leading into the trees. Fresh bootprints in the mud. Recent—last day or two.

Jack followed it twenty yards before it disappeared into dense undergrowth. No indication where it led. Back toward the road? Deeper into the mountains? He made a mental note and returned to the compound.

The generator shed was next. Still padlocked. Through the window, the generator hummed steadily, fuel tanks three-quarters full. Enough to run for weeks. Recent maintenance—clean oil, new filters.

Someone had been here recently.

He circled to the back of the station building, where Marie was photographing the breaker panel. She looked up, face grim.

"No FCC license. I've been through everything. Equipment manuals, maintenance logs, listener letters. But zero legal documentation. No permits, no call sign registration."

"Could he keep that somewhere else?"

"Why? Everything else is here. Except the one thing that would make this legal."

"How long does a pirate station usually operate before getting shut down?"

"Weeks. Maybe months if they're clever. The FCC doesn't mess around—unauthorized broadcasting is federal crime. Fines, equipment seizure, jail time." She looked at the tower. "This station has been here twenty years. Same location. Powerful enough to reach three states. That's impossible unless Raymond's been actively hiding. Signal bouncing, irregular schedules. Constant effort."

"Or being somewhere the FCC can't easily reach."

They both looked at the forest surrounding them. Miles of mountain wilderness, twenty-three miles from the nearest town. Hard to triangulate a signal through this terrain. Harder still to send investigators up a barely maintained mountain road.

Isolation as defense.

Paulie found them at mid-morning, electrical map in hand. "Power's weird," he said without preamble. "Generator feeds the whole compound, but there's a secondary draw I can't account for."

"What kind of draw?" Marie asked.

"Significant. Like someone's running equipment I haven't seen. Heating, maybe, or more broadcast gear. But I've been through the whole station—everything's accounted for." He pointed to his diagram. "The math doesn't add up. Power goes somewhere we haven't found."

"Hidden room?" Jack suggested.

"Maybe. Or underground cable running somewhere else. I can't tell without digging up lines."

A shout from the tower interrupted them. Leon, halfway up the access ladder, waving.

They ran over. Leon climbed down, breathing hard, eyes bright with adrenaline.

"Nothing up there," he said. "Just transmission equipment. But I could see for miles. No roads except the one we came in on. No buildings. No people. We're completely isolated."

"We knew that," Marie said.

"Yeah, but seeing it—" Leon gestured helplessly at the mountains stretching in every direction. "We're really alone up here."

The implication hung heavy. If Raymond didn't come back, if something went wrong, they were twenty-three miles from help on foot. In October. In the mountains.

"Did you see Coopersville?" Jack asked.

"Yeah. Tiny. Maybe twenty buildings total. Doubt they even have police."

"Fantastic," Paulie muttered.

Shelly emerged from the bunkhouse as they regrouped. "Find anything useful?" Her tone made it clear she hoped the answer was no.

"Raymond's living quarters," Marie said. "Want to show us?"

Shelly hesitated, then nodded.

They followed her into the station, through the main room and down a short hallway Jack hadn't noticed before. At the end: a door marked PRIVATE. Unlocked. Shelly opened it.

Inside: a monk's cell. Cot with military corners. Hotplate. Mini fridge. Sink. Shelf with toiletries. On the wall, a single photograph: woman with dark hair, bright smile, standing beside a 1950s car. "Margaret, 1961."

"His wife," Shelly said quietly. "She died in 1961. That's when he started the station."

Jack examined the room. The cot made but sheets not fresh. Fridge with expired milk, hard cheese. Moldy bread on the counter. "When was he last here?"

"I don't know," Shelly admitted. "But he's coming back. People don't just abandon—"

"Shelly." Marie's voice cut through. "Look around. This hasn't been occupied in weeks. Maybe longer."

"You don't know that."

"The food. The dust. The—"

"You're wrong." Shelly's voice rose. "He's delayed. Something came up. He'll explain when he gets here."

Marie opened her mouth, closed it, exchanged a look with Jack. Not worth the fight.

They continued the search. Jack found tools, spare parts, maintenance supplies. Everything needed to keep the station running indefinitely. But no recent activity. No current projects half-finished, no signs of life in the past few weeks.

Around noon, Paulie called them outside.

"Phone line," he said, pointing to where the cable entered the building. "It's cut. See?"

The cable hung loose, severed cleanly about three feet from the junction box. The cut was fresh—copper still bright, no corrosion.

"Could have been weather," Shelly said immediately. "Wind, or an animal."

Paulie knelt, examining it. "It's a clean cut. Tool marks. Someone did this deliberately."

Silence.

Jack felt cold that had nothing to do with the October air. "When?"

"Sometime in the last week, based on oxidation. Could be more recent."

"Before we arrived," Marie said slowly. "Someone cut the phone line before we got here."

"Or after," Leon pointed out. "We wouldn't have heard it. We were in the bunkhouse, then inside the station."

"Either way," Marie said, "we can't call out."

Shelly wrapped her arms around herself. "The van. We can drive to Coopersville, use a phone there."

Jack had a bad feeling. "Let's check it."

They walked to where he'd parked the van yesterday afternoon—a long time ago now, though only eighteen hours had passed. Jack climbed into the driver's seat, turned the key.

The engine cranked. Turned over. Cranked again. Nothing.

"What the hell?" He tried again. Same result. The starter worked, the battery was fine, but the engine wouldn't catch.

Paulie popped the hood. They crowded around. Everything looked normal at first—belts, hoses, battery connections all solid. Then Paulie opened the oil cap and swore.

"What?" Jack asked.

Paulie held it out. The dipstick came out grainy, contaminated. "Sugar in the gas tank. Maybe sand. It's through the fuel system now. Engine's contaminated."

"Can you fix it?" Marie asked.

"Not without draining everything, cleaning the tank, replacing the fuel filter, probably rebuilding the carburetor. Tools I don't have. Parts I don't have. Garage I don't have." He closed the hood. "This van's not going anywhere."

"No." Shelly shook her head. "No, that's—someone made a mistake. Bad gas from a station down the mountain. Dirt in the tank. Something."

"Shelly—"

"Not deliberate. Not sabotage. You're being paranoid."

Leon's voice was quiet. "Phone line cut. Van disabled. Doors locking at nine PM. We're being kept here."

"By who?" Shelly demanded. "Raymond? That's insane. Why invite us just to trap us?"

No one had an answer. Just the facts, cold and undeniable. No phone. No transportation. Twenty-three miles from help through mountain wilderness. And somewhere, Raymond Peck, who should have been here to greet them, was absent.

Marie checked her watch. "It's past noon. He said morning. He's not coming."

"He's delayed," Shelly insisted.

"Or he's not planning to come at all," Leon said.

"Then what?" Jack asked. "What's the point of all this?"

They stood in the cold afternoon, fog rolling through the valley below, temperature dropping. The tower hummed above them. The generator purred. The compound sat maintained and orderly and completely empty except for the five of them.

"We have options," Marie said finally. "We can hike out. Twenty-three miles. Carry what we can. It'll take all day, maybe into evening, but we can reach Coopersville."

"In this?" Leon gestured at the fog. "Temperature's dropping. Trail's gravel and mud. If we get lost—"

"We have the road."

"If the weather holds."

They looked at the sky. Gray, heavy, threatening. The forecast had called for possible rain, maybe sleet in the mountains. October storms could come fast up here.

"Or we wait," Paulie said. "One more night. Give Raymond until tomorrow morning. If he doesn't show, we hike out first light."

"Stay here?" Shelly looked relieved. "Yes. That makes sense. One more night."

"If we stay," Marie said carefully, "we do it with eyes open. Locked doors. Take shifts watching. Because something is very wrong here."

"You're overreacting," Shelly said, but her voice wavered.

Jack looked at each of them. Paulie pragmatic, calculating odds. Marie tense, investigator instincts on high alert. Leon excited in a manic way, paranoia vindicated. Shelly desperate to believe everything was fine.

"Vote," he said. "Who wants to hike out now?"

Marie raised her hand. Leon, after a moment, did too.

"Who wants to stay until tomorrow?"

Paulie raised his hand. Shelly immediately followed.

They looked at Jack. Deciding vote.

He thought about the fog, the distance, the cold. Thought about the station's mysteries, the automated broadcast, the evidence of careful planning. Thought about Raymond's voice: "I'll be thinking of you."

"One more night," he said. "But we're careful. We stay together. We watch."

Marie nodded, unhappy but accepting.

Leon shrugged. "Your funeral."

"It'll be fine," Shelly said quickly. "Raymond will come tomorrow. You'll see. He'll explain everything."

But as they walked back to the bunkhouse, Jack glanced at the station building's dark windows, the tower looming above, the forest pressing in from all sides.

And he wondered what, exactly, they were waiting for.
