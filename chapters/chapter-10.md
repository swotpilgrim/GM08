# Chapter 10: The Tape Library

Jack couldn't stop staring at the tapes.

Row after row, shelf after shelf, stretching the length of the basement studio. Each reel in its box, each box labeled in Raymond's careful handwriting. Names and dates. Lives reduced to magnetic tape and catalog numbers.

A library of the dead.

"We should leave," Paulie said again. His face was pale, voice tight. "Document what we can and go."

But Marie was already photographing everything, moving methodically down the shelves. "Five minutes. We need evidence authorities can't ignore."

Leon stood frozen, staring at the recording setup—the desk, the mixing equipment, the chair with restraints. "He brought them here. Talked to them. Recorded them. And then..."

"Don't," Jack said. He didn't want to imagine it. But his mind wouldn't stop.

Raymond guiding victims down through the shaft. Making them comfortable. "Just want to record some conversation for the show. You have such a beautiful voice." Relaxing them. Talking for hours, capturing every vocal nuance. Laughing, storytelling, song requests.

Building the library.

And then, when the recording was complete, when Raymond had everything he needed—

Jack's stomach turned.

"I'm going to listen to one," Paulie said quietly.

"Why?" Jack asked.

"Because we need to know. Need to understand what we're dealing with."

Paulie approached the newest tape: David Monroe, September 1982. Last month. Pulled it from the shelf carefully, like handling evidence—which it was. Murder evidence.

The tape deck on Raymond's desk was professional grade, same as everything else in the room. Paulie threaded the tape with practiced hands, checked the levels, pressed play.

Hiss of empty tape. Then Raymond's voice, warm and familiar: "David. Thanks for making the trip up here. I really appreciate it."

A man's voice responded, younger, nervous but excited: "Are you kidding? I've been listening to The Night Caller for years. When you invited me, I couldn't believe it."

"Well, I like to thank dedicated listeners personally. And you have a great voice. Really distinctive. I'd love to get some audio—maybe use it on the show, if that's okay?"

"Seriously? That would be amazing."

"Perfect. Just relax, let's chat. Tell me about yourself. Where you from originally?"

The conversation continued, casual and friendly. David talking about growing up in Charlotte, his job at a bookstore, how he'd discovered The Night Caller during lonely nights after his girlfriend left. Raymond asking gentle questions, drawing him out, getting him to laugh, to express emotion.

Professional interview technique. Building rapport. Getting natural, authentic vocal performances.

Jack glanced at the others. Leon's face was grim. Marie kept photographing but was listening. Paulie watched the tape reels turn, his expression unreadable.

The recording continued. An hour in—Paulie fast-forwarded, sampling sections. Raymond and David still talking, but David starting to sound tired. The conversation getting slower, words slightly slurred.

"Drugged," Paulie said quietly. "In the conversation. Probably in a drink."

Fast forward more. David's voice changing—confusion creeping in. "I don't feel so good. What... what's happening?"

Raymond's voice, still calm, still warm: "It's alright, David. You're alright. Just need you to sit still for me. That's right. In the chair."

"The chair?" David sounding scared now. "Why does it have— are those restraints?"

"For your safety. You're going to feel disoriented for a bit. Don't want you hurting yourself."

"I don't want— I want to leave. I want—"

"Shh. It's alright. We're almost done. Just a few more recordings."

"Please. Please let me go."

And then Raymond's voice shifting—not warm anymore, but clinical. Detached. "Say your name for me, David. Full name."

"What? Why—"

"Say it. Please."

"David... David Monroe."

"Good. And where are you from?"

"Charlotte. Please, I don't—"

"Excellent. Your voice is beautiful, David. Truly beautiful. You're going to live forever. Can you say 'This is my favorite song'?"

"I don't want to—"

"Say it."

"This... this is my favorite song."

"Perfect. And laugh for me. Come on, David. Laugh."

"I can't—"

"Laugh."

A forced, strangled sound. David trying to laugh, fear making it horrible.

Raymond's voice, pleased: "Beautiful. Now, I need you to request a song. Can you do that? Say 'Can you play Georgia on My Mind'?"

"Why are you doing this?" David's voice breaking. "Please. Please just let me go."

"I'm preserving you." Raymond's tone was gentle, like explaining something to a child. "Your voice, your laugh, your way of speaking. After today, you'll never truly die. You'll broadcast forever. Thousands of people will hear you. You'll matter. Beautiful forever."

"That's insane. You're insane. Please—"

Raymond's voice sharpened: "Say the song request."

Silence.

"Say it, or this becomes very unpleasant."

A sob. Then: "Can... can you play Georgia on My Mind?"

"Wonderful. See? That wasn't hard."

The tape continued. More phrases, more emotional samples. Raymond directing David like an actor, capturing every vocal variation—happy, sad, scared, calm. Building a complete library of sounds that could be edited into endless combinations.

David begging. Raymond unmoved.

Eventually, David's voice got quieter. Weaker. The drugs taking him deeper.

"Almost done," Raymond said softly. "Just one more thing. I need you to understand—this is a gift. You're lonely, David. Disconnected. But now you'll be with people every night. Your voice reaching thousands. They'll hear you and feel less alone. That's beautiful. That's immortality."

"Please..." Barely a whisper. "Don't... don't kill me."

"I'm not killing you. I'm preserving you."

Silence. Then sounds Jack couldn't quite identify—struggle, muffled noises, something being moved.

Then quiet. Just Raymond's breathing.

And then Raymond's voice, still warm, still calm, talking to the silence: "Thank you, David. You were perfect. Your voice is exquisite. I'm going to take such good care of it. Use it properly. You'll see—you'll live forever now. Never forgotten. Never silent."

Sound of Raymond humming, moving around. Organizing equipment. Cataloging.

The tape ended.

The basement studio fell silent except for breathing—four living people confronting evidence of methodical murder.

"Oh God," Jack whispered. He felt sick, violated. They'd listened to a man die. Listened to Raymond killing him, preserving him, turning him into audio samples.

Leon was shaking. Marie had stopped photographing, her face ashen.

Paulie carefully stopped the tape, removed it, placed it back in its box. "David Monroe, September 1982," he read. "Probably one of many identical recordings."

"How many?" Marie asked.

They counted. Jack took one wall, Marie the other, Leon and Paulie the end shelves. Calling out names and dates, trying to stay clinical, professional.

But the names accumulated: Thomas Hendricks, 1963. Angela Martinez, 1971. Jennifer Holcomb, 1978. Michael Chen, 1975. Sarah Williams, 1969. On and on.

Fifty-three tapes total.

Fifty-three people Raymond had drugged, restrained, recorded, and killed.

Fifty-three voices broadcast forever.

"This is evidence," Marie said, voice shaking but determined. "Murder evidence. We photograph everything, document it all, get it to authorities."

"And then what?" Leon asked. "We hike twenty-three miles? Hope Raymond doesn't find us first?"

"Yes," Jack said firmly. He couldn't stay here anymore. Couldn't breathe the same air as this collection, this library of atrocity. "We leave now. Pack what we can, start walking."

"It's afternoon," Paulie said. "We have maybe four hours of daylight. Won't make it to Coopersville before dark."

"Don't care. We start walking. Get distance between us and this place."

"What about Shelly?" Marie asked.

They'd left her above ground, refusing to come down. Jack had forgotten about her in the horror of discovery.

"We get her," he said. "Show her this if we have to. She has to see the truth."

They climbed back up—Leon first, then Marie with her camera full of damning photos, then Paulie, then Jack. The shaft felt tighter going up, more confining. Jack's breath came short, panic edging in. Had to get out. Had to get away.

They emerged into the equipment room. Shelly wasn't there.

"Shelly?" Jack called. "Shelly!"

No response.

They ran to the bunkhouse. Empty. Her things still there—purse, jacket—but Shelly gone.

"Where—" Marie started.

Leon pointed out the window. Shelly walking toward the tower, moving with purpose.

They ran after her, catching up as she reached the tower's base fence.

"Shelly, wait," Jack said.

She turned, eyes red from crying but face set with determination. "You were right. About everything. I've been... I've been stupid. Denying reality because I couldn't handle the truth."

"It's okay," Marie said gently. "We understand. This is traumatic."

"No. It's not okay. I defended him. Defended a killer. Because his voice made me feel special." She laughed bitterly. "Pathetic."

"Shelly—"

"I listened at the window. Heard the tape. Heard what he did to David Monroe." Tears streaked her makeup. "And I realized—he was going to do it to me. To all of us. Record us. Kill us. Make us part of his collection."

"Yes," Jack said quietly. "That's why we need to leave. Right now."

"I know. I'm ready." Shelly wiped her eyes. "Let's go."

They returned to the bunkhouse, packed quickly—water, food, warm clothes, Marie's evidence photos, Leon's notebooks. Essentials only. Travel light, move fast.

As they prepared, Jack couldn't stop thinking about the basement. Fifty-three people. Twenty years of murder. All so Raymond could preserve voices, create intimacy, broadcast connection that wasn't real.

A lonely man trying to prevent loneliness by killing the lonely.

The insanity of it was staggering.

"Ready," Paulie said, shouldering his pack.

They checked the road—clear. Fog had lifted slightly, visibility maybe a hundred yards. Enough to navigate by.

"Twenty-three miles," Marie said. "If we maintain three miles per hour, seven to eight hours walking. Should reach Coopersville by midnight."

"Then let's move," Jack said.

They headed for the gate.

Behind them, the compound sat silent. The station building with its hidden basement. The tower broadcasting Raymond's automated show. The bunkhouse where they'd slept, unknowing, while being monitored and studied.

A trap they'd walked into willingly.

But they were leaving. Getting out. Getting help.

Or so Jack hoped.

Because somewhere in these mountains, Raymond Peck waited. And his collection needed five more voices.
