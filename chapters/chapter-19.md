# Chapter 19: Raymond Responds

The next night, Jack was back in the booth. Same position, same headphones, same broadcast running its automated program. Twenty-four hours since his psychological warfare attempt. Twenty-four hours of silence from Raymond.

Maybe it hadn't worked. Maybe the killer had run, taken what he could carry and disappeared into the mountains. Or maybe he was out there in the dark, planning, preparing, getting ready to come back and finish what he'd started.

Jack watched the program clock. 10:47 PM. The broadcast had been running for forty-seven minutes. Glen Campbell singing "Wichita Lineman." The song faded out. Three seconds of dead air.

Then Raymond's voice.

But different. Not the pre-recorded warmth they'd been hearing for days. This was live. Real-time. Jack could hear it in the audio quality—the subtle compression of the live microphone feed, the room tone underneath, the breath before words.

"Jack."

Jack's blood went cold. Through the window, he saw the others freeze. Paulie's hand stopped mid-reach for a tool. Marie's pen hung above her notebook. Leon turned toward the speakers. Shelly pressed herself against the wall.

"I've been listening." Raymond's voice was everything Jack remembered from years of late-night listening. Warm, measured, intimate. But underneath—something hard. Disappointed. "You think you understand, but you've only seen pieces."

Jack reached for the microphone, but Marie shook her head sharply. Let him talk. Hear what he says.

"Jack Sullivan." Raymond spoke like he was reading from notes. Like he'd memorized everything about them. "Twenty-three years old. University of New Hampshire. College radio DJ, graveyard shift. You entered my contest because The Night Caller inspired you to do radio. You saw this weekend as meeting your hero."

Jack's skin crawled. Raymond's tone was gentle, almost paternal.

"Marie Torres. Twenty-four. Graduate student, Penn State. Communications thesis on FCC regulation of pirate radio. You entered because I was a case study. You never loved the show. You saw it as data."

Through the window, Marie's face had gone pale.

"Paulie Rizzo. Twenty-six. Sound engineer, Hoboken. You entered because you wanted to see my equipment. The technical setup fascinated you more than the broadcasts themselves. You appreciated my craft."

Paulie sat down heavily in a chair.

"Leon Kowalski. Twenty-nine. Ham radio enthusiast, numbers station hobbyist. Cleveland. You entered because you believed The Night Caller was part of something larger. A network. A conspiracy. You were right, Leon. Just not the conspiracy you imagined."

Leon's hands were shaking.

"And Shelly Vaughn. Twenty-one. Bank teller from Tennessee. You entered my contest six times, Shelly. Six times. More than anyone else. You loved my voice. You recorded every show on cassette tapes. You felt like I was speaking directly to you."

Shelly made a sound like she'd been struck.

"I know all of you," Raymond continued. His voice was still warm, still The Night Caller's characteristic gentleness. But there was something beneath it now. Possession. Control. "I've been listening since you arrived. Your arguments. Your theories. Your discovery of my basement studio. Every word."

The hidden microphones. He'd been listening to everything.

"You found my journals. My victim selection notes. My broadcast schedules. Twenty years of careful work, laid out for you to examine. And what did you conclude, Jack? That I'm a monster? That I'm lonely? That I've confused illusion with reality?"

Raymond's voice shifted. Still gentle, but with an edge.

"You're wrong."

Jack wanted to respond, to engage, but something kept him quiet. Raymond was building to something. Let him finish.

"You said I don't understand parasocial relationships. But Jack—you're wrong. Radio is the most real connection humans have created. More real than face-to-face conversation. More real than touch."

Through the speakers, Jack could hear Raymond moving.

"Face-to-face, you're distracted. Appearance, mannerisms, environment. But radio? Pure voice. Pure thought. Transmitted directly into the listener's mind. No distractions. Just voice."

Raymond paused.

"That's why Margaret's voice was so important. Without her physical presence, her voice remained perfect. Unchanging. Eternal. As long as I could hear her speak, she was alive. Not metaphorically. Actually alive, present with me through sound waves."

Jack's throat was tight. This was the delusion. The core of Raymond's madness.

"When her tape degraded, when I started losing her voice to static, I understood something," Raymond said. "Death isn't the stopping of the heart. Death is silence. As long as someone's voice transmits, as long as sound waves carry their words and laughter and breath through the air, they're still here. They haven't died. They've just... changed medium."

The broadcast booth felt smaller. Colder.

"That's what I'm preserving. Not recordings. The people themselves. Jennifer Holcomb isn't dead. She's transmitting. Every Tuesday at 10:45 PM, her voice goes out across three states. She exists. How is that not life?"

Marie was furiously writing, hands shaking.

"Thomas Hendricks. David Monroe. All of them. They're not buried corpses. They're voices in the air. Eternal. Unchanging. Perfect. I gave them immortality, and you call it murder."

Raymond's voice softened.

"I'm not angry you don't understand. Most people don't. They see death as final. They don't understand that radio defeated death decades ago."

A sound through the speakers. Tape reels turning. Raymond was playing something.

"Margaret."

A woman's voice filled the airwaves. Warm, genuine, full of life. Laughing. "Raymond, you're being silly. Of course I love you. Why would you even ask?"

The recording was pristine. 1961 quality, carefully preserved. Margaret Peck's voice, transmitted across twenty-one years of technology and grief.

"That's my wife," Raymond said gently. "Died March 17, 1961. Except she didn't die. Listen. She's right here. Alive. Laughing. Loving me. Death couldn't take her because I preserved her voice. And now she broadcasts with me every night. Keeping me company. Helping me save others."

Jack felt sick. Raymond believed it. Genuinely believed that recordings were the people themselves, that broadcasting voices meant defeating death.

"The thirty-two people in my journals—they were dying anyway. Dying of loneliness. Living isolated with no connections. I gave them purpose. Eternity. Their voices will broadcast forever. Isn't that better than forgotten graves?"

Shelly was crying silently. Marie's face was stone. Paulie looked sick. Leon stared at the speakers.

"You asked if Margaret would want this," Raymond said. "If she'd want me to spend twenty years saving people in her name. But Jack—she's here. Listen."

Another clip of Margaret's voice. "You have such a good heart, Raymond. You want to help everyone. That's what I love about you."

"She understands," Raymond said. "She's been helping me select voices. Telling me which people need to be made eternal."

Delusion upon delusion. Raymond believed Margaret's recording was consciously guiding him.

"You have beautiful voices," Raymond said. His tone shifted. Warmer. Almost affectionate. "All five of you. That's why I selected you. Jack—your voice has that overnight DJ quality. Intimate, warm, perfect for 2 AM broadcasts. Marie—precise diction, intelligent, the kind of voice that makes people listen. Paulie—bass tones, authoritative, the voice of someone who knows what they're talking about. Leon—enthusiasm, genuine passion, the voice of someone who cares about connection. And Shelly—oh, Shelly. Your voice is exactly what lonely people need to hear. Sweet, vulnerable, hopeful."

Jack's hands gripped the edge of the console.

"I'm going to preserve all of you," Raymond said gently. "You'll join the broadcasts. Jack can introduce requests. Marie can read poetry. Paulie can discuss music. Leon can share theories. Shelly can comfort late-night callers. All of you broadcasting forever."

Marie shook her head. No.

"You think I'm coming to hurt you," Raymond said. "But I'm coming to save you. To rescue you from the temporariness of physical existence and give you something better. Something eternal. Your voices will never age. Never deteriorate. Never die. Isn't that what everyone wants? To be remembered? To matter? To continue beyond the body's limitations?"

He paused. The broadcast continued underneath—some instrumental transitioning to a new song.

"I'll be back tomorrow night," Raymond said. "Everything is ready for your preservation. The recording equipment is calibrated. The editing suite prepared. Your broadcast schedules planned. Everything is ready."

Shelly whimpered.

"Don't be afraid," Raymond said softly. "The process is gentle. The fear lasts a few hours, then you're free. Free from bodies. Free from time. Free from death. Pure voice, transmitting forever. Margaret will welcome you."

Jack couldn't stay silent anymore. He opened his microphone.

"Raymond—"

"Don't," Raymond interrupted. Still gentle. "Don't try to convince me otherwise. I've heard all the arguments. Twenty years of FCC investigators, police, families searching. Everyone says I'm wrong. That recording isn't life. That transmission isn't existence. But they're all trapped in physical thinking. They can't conceive of a different form of life. One that exists in radio waves and sound and the minds of listeners."

His voice was certain. Absolute.

"You'll understand soon," Raymond said. "Once you're preserved. Once you're broadcasting. You'll realize I was right. That I saved you. That radio immortality is the only real immortality. And you'll be grateful."

The broadcast shifted. Raymond's voice faded, replaced by his pre-recorded programming. Song. Weather. Gentle comments. As if the live intrusion had never happened.

But it had. They all heard it. Raymond Peck's philosophy laid bare. His delusion articulated with perfect clarity. He genuinely believed he was saving people. That murder was transformation. That recordings were resurrection.

And he was coming back tomorrow night to add their voices to his eternal collection.

Jack pulled off his headphones. His hands were shaking. The others emerged from the equipment room, faces pale with horror.

"He's completely insane," Marie whispered.

"And he's coming back," Paulie said. "Tomorrow night. We have maybe twenty-four hours."

Leon looked at the equipment. "Can we get an SOS out before then?"

"I'm working on it," Paulie said. "But those traps—"

"Work faster," Jack said. His voice was harder than he'd ever heard it. "Because Raymond isn't going to stop. Isn't going to change his mind. He believes this with every fiber of his being. Radio immortality isn't a rationalization for him. It's his entire worldview."

Shelly spoke quietly. "He thinks he's doing us a favor."

"Which makes him more dangerous," Marie said. "Killers who know they're evil can be reasoned with, bargained with, appealed to. But Raymond thinks he's a savior. You can't reason someone out of saving you."

Outside, dawn was still hours away. The transmission tower broadcast Raymond's voice to three states. And somewhere in the dark mountains, Raymond Peck was preparing. Calibrating recording equipment. Planning their preservation. Getting ready to transform five more people into radio waves and dead voices transmitting forever.

They had one day. One day to call for help, to disable the traps, to prepare for confrontation.

One day before The Night Caller came home to save them from mortality.
