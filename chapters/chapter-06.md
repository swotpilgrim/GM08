# Chapter 6: Audio Artifacts

Paulie had been listening to audio his entire professional life. He knew what real sounded like.

This wasn't real.

He sat in the broadcast booth at 11 PM, professional headphones clamped over his ears, monitoring The Night Caller's signal. Leon had set up his cassette recorder, capturing everything for later analysis. The others were downstairs—Jack examining more documentation, Marie photographing equipment, Shelly just watching the broadcast like always.

But Paulie was listening. Really listening.

Raymond's voice flowed smooth and warm: "Beautiful night for radio, isn't it? There's something about October, the way the air gets crisp. Makes you want to stay inside, stay warm. Let me keep you company."

Perfect delivery. Professional pacing. Mic technique flawless—just the right distance, controlling plosives, managing sibilance. Raymond knew radio.

A song played: "Unchained Melody" by The Righteous Brothers. Clean vinyl pressing, minimal surface noise. Paulie checked the turntable—automatic return perfectly timed. The engineering was beautiful.

Then, midway through the song, Raymond's voice returned: "Let's take a call. Caller, you're on The Night Caller."

Static hiss. Click. Then a woman's voice: "Hi Raymond. This is Jenny from Bristol."

Paulie stopped breathing.

He rewound the tape—Leon's recorder had caught it. Played it again. Listened closer.

There. Right there.

He took off the headphones, heart pounding. "Jack! Marie! Get up here!"

They came quickly, alarmed by his tone. Leon followed, notebook ready.

"Listen to this." Paulie cued the tape to the call. "Tell me what you hear."

They listened. Jenny from Bristol requesting "Stand By Me." Raymond's warm response. The conversation flowing naturally.

"Sounds normal," Jack said.

"Listen again. Closer." Paulie put the headphones on Jack, played it again. "Focus on the background noise. The reverb. The acoustic space."

Jack's expression changed. "It's... different?"

"It's wrong." Paulie took the headphones back, played it for himself again. "Phone calls have characteristic acoustic signatures. Bandlimited frequency response—cuts off highs and lows. Compression from the phone system. Specific reverb from being in a room, speaking into a handset."

"English, Paulie," Leon said.

"Phone calls sound like phone calls. This doesn't."

He pulled out his portable audio analyzer—a piece of gear he'd brought to examine the station's equipment. Connected it to Leon's recorder. Played back the "phone call."

The analyzer's display showed frequency response, dynamic range, compression ratios. Paulie traced the patterns with his finger.

"See this? Full frequency response. Twenty to twenty thousand Hertz. A phone line cuts off at about three thousand. This is studio quality audio masquerading as telephone."

Marie leaned in. "Could be equipment on Raymond's end? Better phone system?"

"No. Physics doesn't work that way. Telephone networks are bandlimited by design—saves bandwidth. You can't get studio quality through a phone line no matter what equipment you use."

"So it's not a real call," Jack said slowly.

"Not over a phone line, no." Paulie cued up another section. "Listen to the background. Behind Jenny's voice."

They listened. Very faint, almost inaudible, but there: room tone. The subtle ambient sound of a small acoustic space. Paulie boosted the bass frequencies, filtered out Jenny's voice. The room tone became clearer.

"That's the same room tone as Raymond's voice," he said. "Same acoustic signature. Same subtle reverb pattern. She's not calling from Bristol. She's in the same space as Raymond. Or was."

"Could've been recorded here," Paulie said. "In this booth or somewhere with similar acoustics. Then edited to sound like a phone call. That's why the reverb doesn't match—it's studio recording processed to simulate phone quality, but the processing isn't perfect."

Leon was writing frantically. "Check the other calls. All of them."

They spent the next hour monitoring every caller. Paulie analyzed each one, running them through his equipment, breaking down the audio forensically.

Thomas from Asheville requesting "Blue Moon": Full frequency studio recording processed to fake phone line compression. Same acoustic space as Raymond.

Angela from Roanoke wanting "Dream a Little Dream": Studio recording. Same acoustic signature.

David from Charlotte asking for "Georgia on My Mind": Studio recording. Same space.

Every single caller. All fake.

"Okay." Marie's voice was tight. "So Raymond pre-records calls. That explains the automation—he scripts everything in advance, records it all, programs the system to play it at specific times. Question is why?"

"Intimacy," Jack said. "The whole appeal of The Night Caller is feeling heard, feeling connected. People call in, share their loneliness, Raymond responds. That's the relationship. If listeners found out the calls were fake—"

"The illusion breaks," Paulie finished. "No more intimacy. Just a guy playing records."

"But why go to such elaborate lengths?" Marie asked. "Why build this system, maintain it for twenty years, just to fake radio intimacy?"

No one had an answer.

Paulie went back to the analyzer. Something else was bothering him. He pulled up Thomas's call—the "Blue Moon" request. Examined the waveform.

There. A discontinuity. Fraction of a second, almost invisible, but present. A splice point.

He zoomed in. Two separate recordings, edited together. Raymond asking "What would you like to hear?" on one recording. Thomas responding "Can you play 'Blue Moon'?" on another. Cut together so seamlessly most ears would never notice. But the analyzer caught it—infinitesimal timing shift, microscopic difference in background noise.

"They're not even continuous conversations," he said, showing the others. "Raymond's questions are separate from the responses. Mix-and-match. He could have ten recordings of himself asking 'What would you like?' and fifty recordings of people requesting songs, and combine them in any order."

"Like Mad Libs," Leon said. "Fill in the blanks."

"Exactly. Modular audio. Record the pieces once, recombine them endlessly."

Shelly appeared in the doorway. "What are you doing?"

"Analyzing the broadcast," Paulie said. "The calls are fake. Pre-recorded, edited to sound live."

"I know that." Shelly's voice was defensive. "We figured that out last night."

"But look at this." Paulie showed her the splice points. "These aren't even full conversations. They're fragments cut together. Some of these voice recordings could be years old."

"So Raymond's efficient. He doesn't waste time recording the same caller making the same request over and over."

"Or," Leon said quietly, "the callers can't make new recordings anymore."

The temperature in the booth seemed to drop.

"What does that mean?" Shelly asked.

Leon flipped through his notebook. "Jenny from Bristol. I've logged her requesting 'Stand By Me' eight times over two years. Always the same conversation. Exact same words."

"People request the same songs," Shelly said. "I do it. Favorites."

"But exact same phrasing? Same vocal inflection? Listen." Leon found the recordings, played two from different nights. Side by side.

Identical. Not similar. Identical. Same breath sounds, same pause before the song title, same slight laugh on "that's my favorite." Down to the millisecond.

"It's the same recording played twice," Paulie confirmed. "Copy-paste audio."

"Maybe Raymond saved it and replayed it," Shelly insisted. "Maybe Jenny died, and he plays her old call as a tribute."

"Eight times?" Marie asked. "Over two years? That's not tribute. That's something else."

Paulie went back to his analyzer, pulling up every call they'd recorded over the past two nights. Ran them through pattern-matching software, looking for repeats.

The results made his skin crawl.

"Seventy-three calls logged. Unique voices: fourteen. That means fourteen people providing seventy-three calls' worth of content. Each voice used between three and twelve times."

"So Raymond has a stable of regular callers," Jack said. "People he recorded who call in often."

"Or had," Leon said. "Past tense."

"Stop." Shelly's voice cracked. "Stop making this sound sinister. Raymond records listeners. They probably know. They probably consent. It's for the show."

But Paulie was thinking about consent. About the FCC complaints Marie had shown them—people hearing dead relatives on the broadcast. The woman who heard her daughter's voice four years after the daughter died.

"What if they didn't know?" he said quietly. "What if Raymond recorded them without consent, and they're not alive anymore to object?"

"That's insane," Shelly said.

"Is it?" Leon countered. "Think about it. Pirate radio station, illegal for twenty years. Fake callers using dead people's voices. Host who's been absent for weeks. Phone lines cut. Van sabotaged."

"You're making connections that aren't there," Shelly said desperately.

But Paulie was thinking like an engineer, following the logic of systems. Raymond had built something elaborate—automation sophisticated enough to fake live broadcasts, voice recordings edited to simulate real interaction, signal bouncing to evade detection. That level of effort, that degree of planning, suggested purpose.

But what purpose? Why fake intimacy? Why preserve voices?

"Leon," he said. "Those FCC complaints. The dates people supposedly heard dead relatives—can you cross-reference them with when those voices appear on the broadcasts?"

Leon nodded, already flipping pages.

Marie pulled out her complaint files. They worked together, building a timeline. Thomas Hendricks died in 1963. FCC complaint from his brother in 1964, reporting hearing Thomas request "Blue Moon." Leon's logs showed Thomas's voice on broadcasts continuously from 1964 to present.

Jennifer Holcomb died in 1978. Her mother filed a complaint in 1979. Jenny's voice requesting "Stand By Me" appeared on broadcasts from 1979 onward.

David Monroe—Leon found the obituary in Marie's newspaper archives—died September 1982. Last month. His voice started appearing on broadcasts immediately after.

"Oh God," Marie whispered.

The pattern was undeniable. People died. Their voices appeared on Raymond's broadcasts shortly after. Families heard them, filed complaints, got dismissed as grief-delusional.

But they hadn't been imagining it. Their dead relatives really were on the broadcasts. Recorded before death—or maybe during?

Paulie felt sick. As an engineer, he could admire the technical execution. As a human being, he wanted to run.

"We need to leave," he said. "Now. Right now."

"It's midnight," Shelly said. "Fog, cold, dark. We can't—"

"We can't stay here." Paulie started gathering equipment. "Don't you see? Raymond doesn't just record voices. He preserves them. Uses them. Plays them forever on his show. And the contest—"

"Was to get new voices," Jack finished, his face pale. "We're not guests. We're material."

The booth fell silent. Outside, fog pressed against the windows. Below, the automation system hummed, patient and tireless.

And through the speakers, Raymond's voice: "Still with me, friends? Good. I've got something special coming up. A new voice I think you'll enjoy. Someone fresh. Someone who understands loneliness."

The five of them looked at each other, understanding crystallizing into cold fear.

They needed to leave. But the night was dark, the fog thick, and somewhere in these mountains, Raymond Peck waited with his recording equipment.

Collecting voices.

Forever.
