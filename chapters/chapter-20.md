# Chapter 20: The Graves

Shelly waited until they were focused on the equipment. Jack in the broadcast booth. Marie documenting. Paulie and Leon hunched over the transmitter.

No one noticed when she slipped out the back door.

The October morning was cold, dawn gray and miserable, fog thick below. She'd been awake all night, Raymond's words playing on loop. *Your voice is exactly what lonely people need to hear. Sweet, vulnerable, hopeful.*

He'd described her like he knew her. Like he'd studied her. Like he loved her.

And he was going to kill her for it.

She walked toward the transmission tower. Leon had mapped the burial sites—thirty-two graves in a rough circle around the tower's base, hidden among pine trees. Shelly had seen the map, seen the Polaroids. But she hadn't gone to look. As long as she didn't see them, she could still pretend.

Now she needed to see.

The first grave marker was simple. Wood, hand-carved, the letters cut deep: *Thomas Hendricks. 1963. Forever Broadcasting.*

Shelly knelt in the mud. The wooden marker was weathered but maintained. Raymond had tended these graves for twenty years. Kept them from being overgrown. Marked each one carefully.

She moved to the next. *Jennifer Holcomb. 1978. Forever Broadcasting.*

Jenny from Bristol. The voice Shelly had heard requesting "Stand By Me" just last night. Dead four years. Buried here. Broadcasting anyway because Raymond had recorded her before death and spliced her voice into his shows.

Shelly's hands shook. She touched the marker. The wood was cold, damp from morning fog. A person had been here. A woman named Jennifer who'd called The Night Caller because she was lonely, who'd been invited to visit, who'd thought she was meeting someone who understood her.

Who'd died terrified while Raymond recorded every scream.

The third grave. *David Monroe. September 1982.*

Last month. David had been alive last month. Had driven up this mountain excited, honored. Had disappeared into Raymond's studio and never left. Shelly might have passed him on the road if she'd entered the contest earlier. They might have been contest winners together.

Except Raymond only invited people he planned to kill.

She moved through the graves, reading names. Billy Garrett. Susan Torres. Michael Chen. Thirty-two wooden markers. Thirty-two people who'd trusted a voice on the radio. Who'd come seeking connection and found death instead.

Halfway through, Shelly started crying. Silent at first, then sobbing. Her knees sank into mud. October rain started falling. She didn't care. Couldn't move. Just knelt there touching markers, reading names, confronting denial.

Raymond Peck was a monster.

Not complicated. Not misunderstood. A monster. A serial killer who'd spent twenty years murdering people and playing their voices like records.

And Shelly had loved him.

Not him. His voice. She'd never met Raymond Peck. Never knew what he looked like, how he moved, what he was really like. She'd loved The Night Caller—a radio persona, a constructed intimacy, a voice in the dark that made her feel less alone in her mother's house in Tennessee.

But that voice had lied. Every warm word, every song that felt personal—all performance. Raymond's voice was a lure. A trap. The friendly tone that made lonely people feel safe enough to visit, to drink his coffee.

How many of these thirty-two had felt what Shelly felt? How many had driven up the mountain excited to meet the voice that understood them? How many had sat across from Raymond smiling, trusting, until they realized something was wrong?

"Shelly."

She didn't turn. Didn't want to face them. Didn't want to see the pity or the I-told-you-so or whatever expression they'd have.

"Shelly, you need to come back inside."

Jack's voice. Gentle. The same tone he'd used on the broadcast, trying to reach Raymond. Trying to reach her now.

"I loved him," she whispered. Her voice broke on the words.

Footsteps in mud. Jack sat down beside her, not touching, just present. Rain soaked through his denim jacket. He didn't seem to care.

"I know," he said.

"I loved a murderer."

"You loved a voice," Jack said carefully. "A persona. You didn't know Raymond Peck. None of us did."

Shelly looked at the graves spread around them. Thirty-two lives. Thirty-two people who'd made the same mistake she almost made. "Does that make me stupid? Falling in love with a radio show?"

Jack was quiet for a moment. Rain pattered on leaves. The transmission tower hummed above them, still broadcasting Raymond's warm voice to three states of listeners who didn't know they were hearing a serial killer's propaganda.

"No," Jack said finally. "It makes you human. Everyone wants to feel less alone. Radio creates the illusion of connection—someone speaking directly to you, understanding you, keeping you company through dark nights. That's powerful. That's why people trust it. And Raymond weaponized that trust."

Shelly touched another marker. *Lisa Kowalski. 1976.* Someone's daughter. Someone's friend. Reduced to a voice on a tape, broadcast against her will forever.

"I entered his contest six times," Shelly said. "More than anyone else. He said that. He knew. I kept trying because I wanted... I wanted him to notice me. To hear my voice and think it was special. To pick me." She laughed, bitter and broken. "And he did. Because he wanted to kill me. Because my voice would sound good on his broadcasts after I was dead."

"That's not your fault," Jack said firmly.

"I defended him." Shelly's tears mixed with rain. "You all were trying to warn me, trying to show me evidence, and I kept making excuses. Kept saying his voice was too kind to hurt people. Kept refusing to believe."

"You were processing trauma," Jack said. "Realizing someone you trusted, someone who gave you comfort, was actually a monster—that takes time. There's no right way to handle that."

Shelly looked at him. Really looked at him. Jack was soaked, exhausted, terrified. They were all terrified. But he'd followed her out here anyway. Sat in the mud and rain to make sure she was okay. Didn't tell her to hurry up, to get over it, to stop being emotional.

"Everyone wants to be understood," Jack continued. "To have someone hear them and say 'I get it, you're not alone.' That's human nature. And some people exploit that. They use intimacy as a weapon. Make you trust them, then use that trust to hurt you. That doesn't mean wanting connection was wrong. It means Raymond was a predator who found vulnerable people and victimized them."

Rain fell harder. Thirty-two graves watched them. Thirty-two lives ended because they'd wanted connection. Because they'd heard a kind voice on the radio and thought it meant they'd found someone who cared.

"He said my voice was sweet," Shelly said quietly. "Vulnerable. Hopeful. Perfect for comforting late-night callers. He had my whole broadcast schedule planned. Songs I'd request. Times I'd transmit. He was going to make me part of his collection." She swallowed. "He was going to kill me and play my voice forever, and he thought that was a gift."

Jack nodded. "Yeah. He did. Because he's completely delusional. He genuinely believes radio immortality is real. That recordings are the people themselves. That broadcasting voices means they're still alive. His delusion is so complete, so absolute, that he sees murder as salvation."

"How do we stop someone like that?"

"Carefully," Jack said. "He's coming back tomorrow night. We have maybe twenty-four hours to prepare. Paulie's working on the transmitter, trying to get an emergency broadcast out. Leon's mapping escape routes. Marie's hiding evidence all over the compound. We're doing everything we can."

Shelly looked at the graves one more time. Thirty-two people who'd trusted Raymond. Thirty-two voices stolen and broadcast forever. She thought about becoming number thirty-three. Her voice requesting songs. Her laugh played between programs. Shelly Vaughn preserved in radio waves, transmitting for decades after death, trapped in Raymond's immortality project.

No. No.

She stood up, mud clinging to her jeans. "I want to help."

Jack looked up at her. "Yeah?"

"I know his broadcasts better than anyone. Every show, every pattern, every song he plays. If there's something in his programming that tells us when he's coming, what he's planning—I might be able to find it."

Jack stood, rain dripping from his shaggy hair. "That could help. Really help."

"I loved his voice," Shelly said. "I loved The Night Caller. But Raymond Peck?" She looked at the graves, at the thirty-two markers representing twenty years of systematic murder. "Raymond Peck can go to hell. And I'll do whatever it takes to make sure he doesn't add our names to this circle."

Something had crystallized. The parasocial love, the one-sided devotion, the fantasy that Raymond understood her—all of it burned away by the reality of thirty-two graves. She'd been in denial because accepting the truth meant accepting she'd been fooled. Accepting that connection she'd felt was constructed. Accepting that she'd almost died for a voice that never loved her back.

But now she accepted it. All of it.

Raymond was a monster. His voice was a weapon. And Shelly was done being his victim.

They walked back through the rain. The station building looked different now. Not welcoming. Threatening. Raymond's compound. His studio. His recording equipment waiting to preserve five more voices.

But they weren't going to let him. They were going to fight back. Use their skills, their knowledge, their own voices to survive this.

Inside, the others looked up. Marie's eyes widened seeing Shelly's mud-covered clothes, rain-soaked hair. Paulie paused mid-wire connection. Leon turned from his maps.

"I want to help," Shelly said again. Her voice was stronger now. Certain. "Tell me what you need."

Marie smiled, genuine and warm. "Welcome back."

"Let me grab my broadcast logs," Shelly said. She'd brought three years' worth of cassette recordings, every Night Caller show she'd taped. Obsessive fan behavior that had embarrassed her. Now it might save them. "If Raymond's planning something, if his broadcast schedule gives any clues—I know his patterns well enough to spot changes."

Jack squeezed her shoulder. "Thank you."

Shelly nodded. She was done defending Raymond. Done making excuses. Done being the friction character who complicated their plans because she couldn't face reality.

She'd seen the graves. Touched the markers. Confronted the truth.

Now she was ready to stop the man whose voice she'd loved from adding five more bodies to the circle around the tower.

Outside, rain fell on thirty-two graves. Inside, five people prepared for survival. And somewhere in the dark mountains, Raymond Peck prepared for preservation.

Tomorrow night, one way or another, this would end.
