# Chapter 24: Fight for Voices

The standoff broke when Raymond stepped toward Shelly.

"You first," he said gently, syringe raised. "Your voice will be the sweetest. I'll record you talking about Tennessee, about loneliness, about the nights you spent listening to my broadcasts wishing someone understood—"

"Run!" Jack shouted.

The group scattered exactly as planned. Jack and Leon sprinted for the broadcast booth. Marie ran for the basement stairs, feet pounding. Paulie dove for the equipment room. Shelly hesitated for half a second, then followed Marie down.

Raymond stopped, confused. His victims had never run before. They'd been drugged, compliant, manageable. This wasn't part of his refined process.

"Wait," Raymond said, his voice losing its warm broadcaster tone. "You don't understand. This is necessary. Your voices—"

Jack slammed the broadcast booth door, twisted the lock. Through the window he saw Raymond turn, tracking movement, deciding who to pursue first.

Raymond's eyes fixed on Jack.

"No," Raymond said, moving toward the booth. "Jack, don't. The broadcast—you can't disrupt the broadcast."

Jack threw on the headphones, opened the microphone. A song was playing—some soft instrumental. He cut it off mid-phrase.

"Emergency broadcast," Jack said, his voice going out across three states. "This is Jack Sullivan. I'm trapped at an illegal pirate radio station in the Blue Ridge Mountains, western North Carolina. The operator is Raymond Peck, serial killer, responsible for at least thirty-two murders over twenty years. If anyone is hearing this, call authorities immediately."

Raymond reached the booth door. Tried the handle. Locked. His face appeared in the window—no longer grandfatherly. Desperate. Panicked.

"Jack, stop," Raymond said through the glass. "You're ruining everything. Twenty years of work. Twenty years—"

"Coordinates," Jack said into the microphone. Leon had given him the exact location. He read them clearly. "Latitude thirty-five point seven-six-three-nine. Longitude eighty-two point eight-one-five-two. WKNC transmission tower, Blue Ridge Mountains. Send police. Send park rangers. Serial killer on site."

Raymond pounded on the door. "You don't understand what you're doing! The broadcasts keep them alive! If you expose this, if authorities come, they'll destroy the tapes! Thirty-two voices will be lost! They'll die again!"

"They're already dead," Jack said. "You killed them."

He could see the others through the equipment room window. Paulie at the transmitter, hands moving quickly. Leon positioning himself at the emergency frequency controls. Marie emerging from the basement with boxes of tapes. Shelly helping her.

"I saved them!" Raymond shouted. He wasn't speaking through the glass anymore—he was screaming, his composure completely shattered. "I gave them immortality! Radio immortality! Their voices broadcast forever! That's salvation!"

Jack kept broadcasting. "Raymond Peck. Age fifty-eight. Operates illegal pirate radio station known as The Night Caller. Has been murdering isolated listeners since 1963. Recording their voices and broadcasting them posthumously. Evidence includes extensive tape library, victim journals, photographs, thirty-two graves around transmission tower."

Raymond backed away from the door. Looked around frantically. Saw the emergency axe mounted on the wall—fire safety equipment.

"Don't make me do this," Raymond said. His voice had changed completely. No warmth. No broadcaster smoothness. Raw desperation. "Jack, please. The broadcasts are everything. Margaret is in those tapes. Thirty-two people I saved. If you destroy this, they all die. Really die. Permanently."

"They died when you killed them," Jack said into the microphone. "Everything Raymond Peck told his listeners about preserving voices, about radio immortality—it's all delusion. He's a serial killer who can't process his wife's death. He's been murdering lonely people for twenty years and broadcasting their voices without consent."

Raymond grabbed the axe. Raised it. His hands shook.

"I didn't want it to be like this," Raymond said. "The preservation should be gentle. Beautiful. Not... not this."

He swung the axe at the booth door. The blade bit into wood. Not deep—the booth was sturdy, built to be soundproof—but damage showed.

"Raymond Peck is currently attempting to break into the broadcast booth," Jack narrated into the microphone. His voice was steadier than he felt. "He's armed with an axe. He's trying to stop this broadcast. If authorities arrive and I'm dead, my voice on this recording is testimony. Everything I've said is true. The evidence is here. The graves are here. Raymond Peck killed thirty-two people and he's trying to kill five more."

Another axe swing. Wood splintered.

Through the equipment room window, Jack saw Paulie give a thumbs up. The transmitter was ready. Leon could send the official SOS now, on emergency frequency. Rangers would hear it. Police would hear it. The FCC would hear it.

But Raymond was five feet away, breaking down the door.

"You're destroying beauty!" Raymond screamed between axe swings. "Twenty years of perfect preservation! Voices that will broadcast for centuries! I'm saving people from oblivion and you're calling it murder!"

The door was splintering. Three more swings and Raymond would be through.

Jack grabbed the microphone stand—heavy metal base. If Raymond got through, Jack would have to fight. A DJ with a microphone stand against a serial killer with an axe.

"Send help," Jack said into the microphone. "WKNC transmission tower, Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina. Multiple homicides. Active threat. Send immediate assistance."

Raymond stopped swinging. Breathing hard. He looked at Jack through the splintered door with genuine grief.

"You've killed them," Raymond said quietly. "All thirty-two. They were alive in the broadcasts and you've killed them by exposing this. Authorities will come. They'll destroy the tapes. The voices will be silenced forever. That's murder, Jack. You're the murderer."

He truly believed it.

"I'm trying to give you immortality," Raymond continued. His voice was breaking. "Your voice broadcasting for decades. Hundreds of years if the system is maintained. You'd be remembered. Matter. Continue. Instead you choose death. Oblivion. Silence."

"I choose life," Jack said. "Actual life. Not recordings. Not preservation. Life."

Raymond's face crumpled. Not anger. Devastation. Like he was watching something precious die.

"Then you choose to be forgotten," Raymond said. "And you choose that for the others too. All five of you could have been eternal. Now you'll all just... end."

He raised the axe one more time.

Before he could swing, Shelly's voice echoed from across the station.

"Raymond!"

He turned. Shelly stood at the top of the basement stairs, holding Margaret's tape—the glass case from the studio, the twenty-three-second recording that started everything.

"Is this what Margaret would want?" Shelly asked. Her voice was shaking but clear. "Would she want you to spend twenty years murdering people in her name?"

Raymond's axe lowered. "Margaret understands. She's been helping me select voices."

"No," Shelly said. "Margaret is dead. This is a tape. Twenty-three seconds recorded in 1961. It's not her consciousness. It's not her soul. It's just... sound. Frozen sound from twenty-one years ago."

She held the tape up. "Your wife loved you. I read your journals. She loved you genuinely. Do you think she'd be proud of this? Of what you've become?"

"She's proud," Raymond said, but his voice wavered. "She knows I'm defeating death. She—"

"She's dead," Shelly said gently. "Margaret died in 1961. And you couldn't accept that. So you built this delusion where recordings equal life. Where broadcasting means immortality. But Raymond—it's all in your head. The voices you broadcast aren't alive. The people are still dead. You didn't save anyone. You just... collected evidence of murdering them."

Raymond stared at her. The axe hung loose in his grip.

"Don't let me drop it," Shelly said, holding Margaret's tape over the stair railing. Twenty feet down to the concrete floor. "Don't make me destroy the only real piece of her you have left."

"Don't," Raymond whispered. "Please. That's all I have. That's—"

"Then put down the axe," Shelly said. "Let Jack broadcast. Let the authorities come. Face what you've done. Margaret wouldn't want you to kill five more people. She'd want you to stop."

For a moment, Raymond stood frozen. The axe in one hand. His eyes on Margaret's tape in Shelly's grip. Twenty years of delusion warring with a twenty-three-second recording of the woman he'd loved.

Then from the equipment room, Leon's voice: "SOS is broadcasting. Emergency frequency active. Multiple agencies responding."

Raymond's face changed. Realization hitting. The authorities were coming. The compound would be raided. The tape library seized. His immortality project destroyed.

"No," he said. "No. I can't—they'll take everything. They'll silence all the voices. Margaret, Thomas, Jennifer, everyone. They'll all die if the broadcasts stop."

He looked at Shelly. At the tape. At Jack in the booth. At his whole life's work collapsing around him.

"I won't let them take the voices," Raymond said.

He turned and ran. Not toward Jack. Not toward Shelly. Toward the equipment room.

Toward the transmitter.

Toward the kerosene can he kept for the generator.

And Jack realized with horror what Raymond was planning. If he couldn't preserve them all, he'd destroy everything. Burn the compound. Burn the evidence. Burn the tapes.

Burn himself with Margaret's voice, achieving the final preservation.

"Stop him!" Jack shouted, abandoning the booth.

But Raymond was already there, grabbing the kerosene can, unscrewing the cap.

The battle for voices had become a race against fire.
