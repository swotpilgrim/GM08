# Chapter 21: Planning Survival

Jack spread the compound map across the table. Dawn light filtered through the station building's windows, illuminating the hand-drawn diagram Leon had created: the tower, the station building, the bunkhouse, the generator shed, the graves marked in red circles.

"We have maybe twenty-four hours," Jack said. All five of them stood around the table, truly united for the first time. "Raymond said tomorrow night. That gives us today to prepare."

Marie flipped through her evidence. "We have everything to convict him. Journals, photographs, logs, schedules. The graves. But only if we survive to deliver it."

"Three options," Paulie said. "Hike out. Overpower Raymond. Or use his equipment against him."

Leon paced to the window. The road up the mountain disappeared into fog. "Hike out is twenty-three miles. Rough terrain, Raymond might be watching the road. We'd be exposed."

"And Raymond runs," Jack added. "Takes what he can carry, disappears into the mountains. Without him, without testimony, families might never get full closure."

Shelly spoke quietly. "He won't run. This compound is his life's work. Twenty years. The tape library, the tower, the broadcasts. He believes he's created radio immortality. He won't abandon it."

They all looked at her. She'd returned from the graves different. Harder. Focused. The denial was gone, burned away by thirty-two wooden markers and cold October rain.

"She's right," Marie said. "Raymond's psychology profile indicates extreme attachment to his work. He sees himself as saving people. A savior doesn't abandon their mission."

"Which brings us to option two," Paulie said. "Wait for him to return, overpower him, force him to help us access the equipment safely."

"He's killed thirty-two people," Jack said. "He's methodical, intelligent, and he'll be prepared. Overpowering him means direct confrontation. Physical violence. Against someone who's had twenty years to plan defenses."

Leon nodded toward the booby-trapped equipment. "He rigged mercury switches and fire traps. You think he doesn't have a weapon? Something for when victims resist?"

The room went quiet. They were college students, workers, researchers. Not fighters. The idea of physically attacking Raymond—even in self-defense—felt impossible.

"Option three," Jack said. "We use the equipment against him. Get an emergency broadcast out, bring authorities here while we're still present, trap Raymond on the compound when rangers arrive."

Paulie moved to the transmitter housing. "I've been mapping the traps. The mercury switch on the emergency override is sophisticated, but I think I can bypass it. Not by touching the switch itself, but by accessing the transmitter's frequency selectors directly."

"How long?" Marie asked.

"Four hours. Maybe five. I need to disconnect the power routing without triggering the fire trap, then manually reset the frequency while the transmitter's live. It's dangerous—RF burns if I touch the wrong component—but possible."

Jack looked at the equipment. Four to five hours of careful work, hand inside a live transmitter, one mistake away from electrocution or burns. "Can you do it?"

"Yeah," Paulie said. "I can do it."

"What about Raymond?" Shelly asked. "If he's coming back tomorrow night, he'll arrive before we can get help up the mountain. Even if we broadcast an SOS, rangers are twenty-three miles away."

Leon pulled out his radio equipment. "Emergency frequency reaches park ranger stations. Response time for a distress call with confirmed location is typically two to three hours in good weather. The road is treacherous, single-lane, requires experienced drivers."

"So we broadcast SOS, Raymond arrives, and we have to survive two to three hours until help comes," Marie said.

Jack nodded. "Which means we need a plan for when he gets here. How do we keep him from..." He didn't finish. Didn't need to. They all knew what Raymond wanted. Their voices. Their preservation. Five more additions to his eternal broadcast.

"Psychological engagement," Jack said. "I'll keep trying to reach him through the microphone. Keep him talking, distracted, engaged. As long as he's responding to me, he's not acting."

"I'll position evidence around the compound," Marie said. "Hide copies in multiple locations—buried, taped under surfaces, stored in the van. If Raymond destroys some, others survive. Authorities will have what they need."

"I can provide exact coordinates for the SOS," Leon said. "And monitor the road. I've got binoculars. I can watch for Raymond approaching, give us warning."

Shelly hesitated, then spoke. "I know his broadcast patterns. Every show he's done for three years. If he's planning something specific for tomorrow night, if his programming gives any clues about timing or methodology, I might catch it. I brought all my cassette recordings."

Jack felt something shift. For days, they'd been fractured. Shelly's denial creating friction. Leon's theories dismissed. Paulie's technical focus isolating him. Marie's skepticism alienating. Jack trying to mediate everyone.

Now they were a team. Each person contributing their skills. Each voice adding to the plan.

"Okay," Jack said. "Paulie works on the transmitter. Gets the emergency broadcast ready. Leon monitors the road and provides coordinates. Marie secures evidence. Shelly analyzes broadcast patterns. I'll prepare the psychological approach—what to say when Raymond arrives, how to keep him engaged."

"And if he doesn't want to talk?" Paulie asked. "If he just comes back with a weapon and tries to force us?"

"Then we run," Jack said. "We've mapped escape routes. The forest is dense, we know the compound layout now. We split up, make him chase, buy time until rangers arrive."

It wasn't a perfect plan. Too many variables. Too much depending on Raymond's psychology, on whether he'd respond to engagement or just act. But it was better than nothing. Better than waiting passively for preservation.

They worked through the day. Paulie at the transmitter, mapping circuits carefully. Leon at the window with binoculars, scanning approaches. Marie creating evidence caches—written logs in waterproof bags, photographs in envelopes, hidden throughout the compound.

Shelly listened to three years of Night Caller broadcasts on cassette. Notebook open, marking patterns. Song selections, request timings, analyzing for deviations.

Jack prepared psychologically. Reviewed Raymond's journals, memorized victim details, crafted approaches. If Raymond was calm, mirror calmness. If agitated, de-escalate. If certain, introduce doubt.

As afternoon faded to evening, Paulie called them over.

"I think I've got it," he said. His hands were grease-stained, a small burn mark on his wrist from brushing a hot component. "The mercury switch is isolated. Fire trap is disarmed. I can access the frequency selector without triggering either."

"You can send the SOS?" Jack asked.

"Not me. Leon. He knows the emergency protocol, the proper format for distress calls. But yeah—we can broadcast on emergency frequency. Reach every ranger station in three states."

Leon joined them, coordinates written on a slip of paper. "I'll need maybe three minutes. State the emergency, give location, request immediate assistance. Three minutes on the emergency band and every park ranger, police frequency, FCC monitor will hear it."

"When?" Marie asked.

"Tomorrow night," Jack said. "When Raymond arrives. We need him here, present, when authorities come. If we broadcast too early, he might hear it, run before rangers arrive. We wait until he's on the compound. Then Leon broadcasts while I keep Raymond engaged."

Shelly looked up from her tapes. "His broadcast tomorrow starts at ten PM. Based on his patterns, if he's planning something special, he'll arrive an hour early. Nine PM. Gives him time to prepare equipment, set up recording."

"So we have until nine PM tomorrow to finalize everything," Marie said. "Positions, evidence, escape routes, backup plans."

They worked into the night. Testing communication, practicing scenarios. Raymond arrives calm. Armed. With something unexpected.

At midnight, Marie said, "We should sleep in shifts. Keep watch in case Raymond comes early."

They agreed on rotating watch—two hours each. Jack took first shift. The transmission tower rose into night, still broadcasting Raymond's voice to three states. Lonely listeners hearing dead people request songs, comforted by voices stolen from murdered victims.

Tomorrow night, that would end.

Jack's watch passed quietly. He woke Marie at 2 AM, took her position. Marie woke Paulie at 4 AM. Paulie woke Leon at 6 AM. Leon woke Shelly at 8 AM.

Dawn broke gray and cold. October fog thick in the valleys. The road up the mountain was barely visible through morning mist.

They ate breakfast in silence. Canned food from the bunkhouse. No one spoke much. Fear had settled in, quiet and pervasive.

At noon, they rechecked everything. Evidence caches secure. Transmitter ready. Coordinates confirmed. Psychological approaches prepared. Broadcast patterns analyzed.

At 6 PM, Jack made them eat again. They'd need energy for whatever came next.

At 8 PM, they took positions. Leon at the window with binoculars. Paulie at the transmitter. Marie with evidence and a radio. Shelly in the broadcast booth, ready to analyze any changes to Raymond's programming. Jack in the equipment room, prepared to engage.

8:30 PM. The road was empty. Fog settled heavier.

8:45 PM. Still nothing.

8:50 PM. Leon stiffened. "Wait."

Everyone froze.

"There," Leon said quietly. "On the road. Someone's walking up."

Jack moved to the window. Squinted into the fog. There—a figure, small against the gray mountain backdrop. Walking steadily up the gravel road toward the compound.

"Is it him?" Marie whispered.

Leon adjusted the binoculars. "Can't tell yet. The fog—wait. Yeah. Slight build, cardigan, glasses. It's Raymond."

Jack's heart hammered. "How far?"

"Quarter mile. Maybe ten minutes."

"Everyone ready?" Jack asked.

Paulie's hands were positioned at the transmitter. "Ready."

Marie gripped her radio. "Ready."

Shelly's voice came from the booth. "Ready."

Leon kept his eyes on the approaching figure. "Ready."

Jack took a breath. This was it. Twenty-four hours of preparation coming down to the next few hours. Survival or preservation. Life or radio immortality.

"He's not carrying anything visible," Leon said. "No bags. No obvious weapons. Just... walking. Like he belongs here."

Because he did. This was Raymond's compound. His station. His life's work. Of course he walked like he belonged.

"Five minutes," Leon said.

Jack moved to the broadcast booth. Sat at the microphone. Put on headphones. Through the window, he could see Paulie ready at the transmitter. Leon at his watch position. Marie positioned by the door.

The figure approached through fog. Smaller than Jack expected. Older. Grandfatherly, exactly as the journals suggested. Cardigan, bifocals, soft-soled shoes making no sound on gravel.

Raymond Peck. Serial killer. Radio immortality believer. The Night Caller himself.

He reached the compound fence. Opened the gate. Walked toward the station building like he was coming home.

And five people waited inside, preparing to fight for their lives against a man who thought murder was salvation.

"He's here," Leon whispered.

The door opened. Raymond stepped inside.
