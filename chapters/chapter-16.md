# Chapter 16: Twenty Years of Murder

Leon had been awake for three hours, arranging evidence with the methodical precision that usually made people dismiss him as paranoid. Not now. Now Jack sat across from him nursing cold coffee while Marie documented everything in her notebook, and even Paulie had stopped calling his pattern-recognition skills "conspiracy bullshit."

"Thomas Hendricks," Leon said, tapping the first obituary he'd pulled from Marie's newspaper archives. "1963. Age thirty-four. Called The Night Caller to request 'Blue Moon.' Died two weeks later—official cause listed as accidental drowning. Body found in a creek three miles from this compound."

The evidence covered every surface of the station's main room. Tape labels photographed and arranged chronologically. Burial markers mapped on Leon's hand-drawn diagram. FCC complaints. Missing persons reports. Obituaries. Twenty years of systematic murder laid out in morning light filtering through wood-paneled walls.

Jack rubbed his eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses. "Thomas was the first?"

"The first murder," Leon corrected. He picked up Raymond's journal—the one they'd found in the basement studio, leather-bound and meticulously maintained. "But not the first death Raymond cared about. Margaret Peck. 1961. Car accident. Raymond's wife."

Marie flipped back through her notes. "Two years before Thomas Hendricks."

"Twenty-three months." Leon's fingers traced the timeline he'd constructed on butcher paper stretched across the floor, dates and names connected with red marker. "Margaret dies. Raymond builds this station. Starts broadcasting 1962. Everything's normal for eighteen months—playing records, taking legitimate call-in requests. Then Thomas Hendricks calls, mentions the spliced audio sounds wrong, threatens to report it to the FCC."

His whole life people had told him he saw connections that weren't there. But this—this was real. Every instinct he'd ever had about The Night Caller, validated in the worst possible way.

"Raymond killed him," Shelly said quietly from the corner. She'd been silent most of the night, arms wrapped around herself. "To protect the station."

"To protect the voices," Leon said, reading from Raymond's journal. The handwriting was neat, almost childlike. "Quote: 'Thomas understood what I was doing but saw it as deception rather than preservation. He would have ended the broadcasts. Ended Margaret's voice. I couldn't allow silence.' End quote."

Paulie leaned over the timeline, studying the spacing between deaths. "He killed Hendricks to keep broadcasting. Then what—realized he liked it?"

"Worse." Leon found the next journal entry, dated three months after Thomas Hendricks' death. "He discovered that recording someone before they died, preserving their voice at the moment of maximum fear and pleading, created what he called 'authentic emotional resonance.' He thought their voices sounded more alive on tape than they ever had on phone calls."

The room went quiet except for the generator's distant hum.

Marie set down her pen. "He developed a preference."

"A methodology." Leon spread out the victim selection notes they'd found filed beside the broadcast schedules. Each was a small index card with a caller's name, date, and Raymond's observations. "Jennifer Holcomb, 1978: 'Lonely, isolated, beautiful laugh, minimal family contact.' David Monroe, September 1982: 'Perfect voice, understands radio intimacy, won't be missed.' He was choosing people."

Jack picked up one of the cards. His hand shook slightly. "These are shopping lists."

"Victim profiles." Leon organized them into stacks by year. "Early victims—1963 through 1968—were opportunistic. People who threatened the station or got too close to discovering the splicing. But starting around 1969, the pattern changes. He's selecting based on isolation and voice quality."

Raymond's notes evolved from brief entries to detailed psychological profiles. By the late seventies, he had explicit criteria: people who called repeatedly, who mentioned living alone, who had that desperate quality in their voice.

"He was hunting," Marie said, her analytical tone not quite masking the revulsion underneath.

Leon nodded. "With a twenty-year refinement period." He walked them through the timeline, showing how Raymond's techniques had evolved. "First kills were crude—drownings, falls, things staged as accidents. Bodies found, death certificates issued, cases closed. But around 1971, he switches to methods that let him control the dying process. Suffocation. Overdoses. Quiet deaths that he can record in detail."

Paulie examined the equipment manifests Leon had organized. "His audio quality improves too. Early tapes would've been phone-line recordings. But by the mid-seventies, he's got professional microphones, multi-track recording capability, editing equipment that wouldn't be out of place in a commercial studio."

"He was perfecting his craft," Leon said. The words tasted awful, but they were accurate. "Every murder taught him something. Better victim selection, better recording, better editing."

Raymond's broadcast schedules were elaborate documents planning which "voice" would request which song on which night, months in advance. Dead people's preferences programmed like a jukebox.

"Thirty-two confirmed victims," Leon said, indicating the complete list he'd compiled. "Thirty-two people over nineteen years. That's..." He did the math. "Roughly one murder every seven months. Longer than most serial killers operate without getting caught."

Marie looked up from her documentation. "Because he spread them across three states. Different jurisdictions, different investigators. Missing persons cases that nobody connected because the victims were transients, loners, people estranged from families."

"And because he had the perfect cover." Jack's voice was hollow. "A trusted voice on the radio. People who loved The Night Caller would come visit if invited. They'd drink coffee with Raymond, sit in his studio, feel honored to be there. Right up until they realized something was wrong."

Leon found the Polaroids. Victims posed with Raymond in the broadcast booth, smiling. Then more photos: the same people restrained, terrified, being recorded. The final photos showed burial, Raymond arranging each body carefully, planting wooden markers like he was tending a garden.

"He kept them close," Shelly whispered. "The graves. He wanted them nearby."

"Part of the compound," Leon confirmed. "He'd walk past them every day. At night, he'd broadcast their voices. In his mind, he was keeping them alive."

Paulie pushed back from the table, pacing to the window. Dawn was breaking over the mountains, fog settling in the valleys below. "This is one of the longest serial killing sprees in American history. The Green River Killer, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy—they got caught faster than this."

"Because Raymond was smart." Leon hated saying it, but the evidence demanded accuracy. "Highly intelligent, patient, meticulous. He planned every kill months in advance. Selected victims who wouldn't be missed. Used his pirate station's illegal status to his advantage—no official records, no paper trail."

Marie studied the psychological profile she'd been compiling. "Organized serial killer. Classic characteristics: above-average intelligence, socially competent, methodical planning, controlled crime scenes. The opposite of disorganized killers who act impulsively."

"He's been hiding behind that voice for twenty years," Jack said quietly. "Playing the warm, friendly Night Caller while building a tape library of people he murdered. And everyone—listeners, families, us—we all trusted him because his voice sounded kind."

Leon organized the final pieces of evidence: the contest forms they'd filled out, annotated with Raymond's observations about each of them. Jack's form: "Understands radio intimacy, excellent voice control." Marie's: "Skeptical but thorough, would appreciate the archive." Paulie's: "Technical knowledge, could understand the craft." His own: "Isolated, perfect pattern-recognition, beautiful paranoid energy." Shelly's: "Devoted, ideal voice, true believer."

"We were selected," Leon said. "The contest wasn't random. He chose us as deliberately as he chose every other victim. We have the qualities he values—connection to radio, isolation, voices he wants to preserve."

The weight of it settled over the room. They weren't contest winners. They were invited prey.

Jack stood, walking to the timeline Leon had constructed. Thirty-two names. Thirty-two deaths. Twenty years of patient, methodical evil hidden behind the most trusted voice in three states' worth of radio listeners.

"Where is he now?" Jack asked.

Leon had been asking himself the same question since Raymond's broadcast last night. The man knew they'd discovered everything. Knew his crimes were exposed. Knew they'd found the basement studio, the tapes, the evidence that would convict him of decades of murder.

"Watching," Leon said. He pointed to the hidden microphones they'd located throughout the building. "He installed these. He's been listening to every conversation we've had. He knows we found the timeline, the victim selection notes, all of it."

"Then why hasn't he come back?" Paulie asked.

Marie's voice was grim. "Because he's deciding what to do with us. Whether to cut his losses and run, or complete what he started."

"He won't run," Leon said. "This compound—the station, the tower, the graves, the tape library—this is his life's work. Twenty years of construction. In his mind, he's created something beautiful. Something that defeats death."

"Radio immortality," Jack said softly.

"He believes it," Leon confirmed. "Reading his journals, his victim notes, his broadcast schedules—he genuinely thinks he's helping people. Saving them from being forgotten. The murders aren't evil to him. They're preservation. Collection. He's building an eternal audience."

Shelly made a sound that might have been a sob or a laugh. "I loved his voice. I thought he understood what it was like to be lonely. And the whole time..."

"He did understand," Leon said. It was the most disturbing realization he'd had while organizing the evidence. "That's what made him effective. He knows exactly what loneliness feels like, what that desperate need for connection does to people. Margaret's death taught him. And instead of processing his grief, he weaponized it."

The morning light grew stronger, illuminating twenty years of murder spread across the room. Leon looked at his timeline, his pattern recognition finally validated in the most horrible way.

"He's coming back," Leon said with certainty. "He knows we have evidence that could expose everything, destroy his immortality project. He can't let us leave with it. Can't let us tell the world what he's built here."

Jack met his eyes. "When?"

Leon thought about the broadcast schedule, Raymond's meticulous planning, the way every detail of the man's life operated on careful timing.

"Soon," he said. "Maybe today. Maybe tonight. But soon."

They had mapped twenty years of systematic evil. Understood the pattern, the methodology, the psychology of the man who'd created it. But understanding Raymond Peck didn't mean they could stop him.

Outside, fog clung to the mountains. The transmission tower rose 200 feet into gray sky, still broadcasting its automated program to three states' worth of listeners who had no idea their beloved Night Caller was one of history's most successful serial killers.

Leon looked at his timeline one more time. Thirty-two victims. Twenty years. One question remaining: would their names be added to the list, or would they be the ones who finally brought the broadcasts to an end?
