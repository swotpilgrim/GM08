# Chapter 23: Immortality Through Airwaves

Raymond held the syringe loosely, like it was just another tool. Not a weapon. Not a threat. Just equipment necessary for his work.

"Before we begin the preservation," he said, still using that warm broadcaster voice, "I want you to understand the process. I've refined it over twenty years. It's become quite elegant."

Jack needed to keep him talking. Every minute Raymond spent explaining was a minute Paulie could work on the transmitter. A minute closer to getting an SOS out.

"Tell us," Jack said. "How does it work?"

Raymond smiled, pleased. He set the syringe down on the table—still accessible, but not threatening. Like he was confident they wouldn't run. "It begins with selection. I listen to my call-in shows carefully. Most listeners are content to simply hear music, hear a friendly voice. But some... some call repeatedly. They mention being alone. Living in isolated places. They have that quality in their voice—the desperate need for connection."

He pulled out a small notebook. Jack recognized it from the basement studio. Victim selection notes.

"Jennifer Holcomb called sixty-three times over eight months," Raymond said, flipping pages. "Always late at night. Always requesting songs about love and loneliness. She told me about her apartment in Bristol, her estranged family, her job at a factory where nobody spoke to her. Sixty-three calls. Sixty-three times she reached out to The Night Caller because she had nobody else."

Shelly made a small sound. She'd called repeatedly too. Had been selected the same way Jennifer was.

"David Monroe called from a pay phone every Friday," Raymond continued. "Truck driver. Cross-country routes. Said the radio was his only companion during eighteen-hour drives. His wife had left him, his children didn't call. Just David, his truck, and The Night Caller between midnight and 3 AM."

Raymond spoke about dead people like they were friends. Like he'd saved them instead of murdered them.

"Once I identify someone suitable, I invite them to visit," Raymond said. "A contest. A special listener appreciation event. An excuse that feels special, that makes them feel chosen. They drive up the mountain excited, honored. They meet me here, and I'm exactly what they expected—a kind voice made flesh. We talk. I offer coffee."

He gestured to the pot on the counter. "Sedatives in the coffee. Not immediately acting. They drink, we converse for thirty to forty-five minutes. By the time they start to feel drowsy, they trust me completely. They think they're getting tired from the drive, from the mountain altitude. When they can barely keep their eyes open, I help them to the studio."

Jack felt sick. Imagined those thirty-two people, sitting where he was sitting, drinking coffee with Raymond, feeling sleepy, trusting this gentle-looking man right up until it was too late.

"The studio is soundproofed," Raymond said. "Recording equipment already calibrated. I position them comfortably, attach microphones, and begin the real work. Hours of conversation. I ask about their lives, their memories, their dreams. Everything that makes them who they are. And I record it all."

He pulled out a tape player. Set it on the table. Pressed play.

A woman's voice, relaxed and happy: "I loved Tennessee autumns. The way the leaves would turn orange and—" A pause. Confusion entering her tone. "Why am I so tired? What was in that coffee?"

Raymond's voice on the tape, gentle: "Just rest, Jennifer. Keep talking. Tell me about Tennessee."

"I don't... Raymond, what's happening?"

"You're being preserved, Jennifer. Your voice is going to broadcast forever. Isn't that wonderful?"

The tape continued. Jennifer's voice moving from confusion to fear to pleading. "Please, I want to go home. I don't understand. Please—"

Raymond stopped the playback. "Jennifer's voice has such warmth. You can hear it even through the fear. That's what makes her perfect for Tuesday and Saturday night requests. Her 'Stand By Me' broadcasts have comforted thousands of listeners."

He pressed play on another section. Jennifer's voice, now edited: "Hi, this is Jenny from Bristol! Could you play 'Stand By Me' by Ben E. King? It always makes me feel less alone."

Spliced together from recordings made while she was drugged and terrified. Edited to sound cheerful, willing, alive.

"The editing process is meticulous," Raymond explained. "I have hours of raw audio—conversation, pleading, final moments. I extract the best pieces. A laugh. A song request. A comment about weather. Then I splice them into broadcast-ready segments. Add appropriate background sounds. Mix the levels until they sound natural. The result is indistinguishable from a live call."

He played more tapes. Different voices. All following the same progression: relaxed conversation, confusion, fear, pleading, then Raymond's careful editing transforming terror into cheerful requests.

"The final stage is the transition," Raymond said quietly. "Once I have sufficient recording—usually eight to twelve hours of usable audio—the physical preservation must occur. The body must stop so the voice can achieve its eternal form."

"You mean murder," Marie said flatly.

Raymond looked at her with disappointment. "I mean transformation. The body is temporary, Marie. It ages, deteriorates, fails. But the voice—the essential self—can be extracted and preserved. I use methods that are quiet, gentle. Suffocation or carefully calibrated overdoses. The physical death is peaceful. And then the voice is free."

He pulled out burial photos. Jack recognized them from the basement. Victims in their graves, Raymond arranging them carefully.

"I bury them around the tower," Raymond said. "Close to where their voices broadcast. They're part of the compound. Part of the eternal transmission. Every night when I play their requests, they're right here. Present. Alive in the only way that matters."

Paulie had his hand behind his back. Signaling. The transmitter was almost ready.

"You keep saying they're alive," Jack said. "But they're tapes, Raymond. Recordings. Not consciousness."

"What is consciousness," Raymond asked, "except electrical signals creating patterns? The brain generates thoughts through neural transmissions. Radio creates thoughts through broadcast transmissions. Both are electricity moving through space, creating meaning in receivers. Why is one life and the other not?"

He genuinely believed it. Saw no difference between brain activity and radio waves.

"I'll prove it to you," Raymond said. He pulled out tonight's broadcast schedule. "These are the voices scheduled for tonight. Jennifer Holcomb at 10:45 PM requesting 'Stand By Me.' Thomas Hendricks at 11:47 PM requesting 'Blue Moon.' David Monroe at 1:15 AM requesting 'Take Me Home, Country Roads.' All of them dead for years. But tonight, thousands of listeners will hear them. Their voices will enter listeners' minds, create thoughts and feelings, provide comfort. How is that different from life?"

"Consent," Marie said. "That's the difference. They didn't choose this. You chose for them."

Raymond looked genuinely puzzled. "They were dying already. Dying of loneliness, of isolation, of being forgotten. Living in places where nobody saw them, heard them, remembered them. I offered them eternal presence. Their voices broadcast across three states, heard by thousands. Instead of dying alone and forgotten, they're part of something beautiful. How is that not consent?"

"Because you killed them!" Shelly shouted. "You murdered them and played their voices like... like records!"

"I saved them," Raymond said patiently. "Shelly, you've been dying slowly in Tennessee. Your mother's criticism erasing you bit by bit. Your job where nobody knows your name. Your empty apartment where you spend nights listening to my broadcasts because they're the only thing that makes you feel real. I'm offering you something better. Your voice transmitted forever. Never erased. Never forgotten."

He picked up the syringe again.

"Your families will hear you," Raymond continued. "Long after tonight, they'll tune in to The Night Caller and hear your voices requesting songs. They'll be comforted knowing you're still present somehow. Children will hear you. Grandchildren. Your voice will outlive your body by decades. By centuries, if the broadcasts continue. That's immortality."

"That's imprisonment," Jack said. "Trapped on tape. Broadcasting against our will. That's not life. That's torture."

"You'll understand once you're preserved," Raymond said gently. "Every victim resists initially. But if they could speak now—if their essential selves could communicate beyond the recordings—they'd thank me. I've given them what every human wants: to matter, to be remembered, to continue beyond death."

He looked at the drugged coffee, then at the syringe. "I prefer the coffee method. It's gentler, creates better initial recordings when you're relaxed. But I understand if you don't trust it. The syringe works too. Faster, more distressing, but the fear in your voices has its own authentic quality."

No one moved.

Raymond sighed. "I'm not enjoying this conflict. I'm trying to save you. Why is that so difficult to understand?"

"Because it's not salvation," Marie said. She was still documenting, her hand shaking but her voice steady. "It's murder with a delusional justification. You're killing people and calling it preservation. Broadcasting their voices without consent and calling it immortality. There's no philosophy here, Raymond. Just a serial killer who can't process grief."

Raymond's gentle expression finally cracked. Not anger. Hurt. "I processed Margaret's death perfectly. I found a way to keep her with me. To defeat silence. And I've spent twenty years helping others do the same. Thirty-two voices that would have been forgotten now broadcast eternally. That's not delusion. That's the most successful preservation project in human history."

He advanced with the syringe.

"The preservation will happen whether you understand it or not," Raymond said. "Your voices are too beautiful to lose. Jack's overnight DJ warmth. Marie's analytical precision. Paulie's technical authority. Leon's passionate enthusiasm. Shelly's vulnerable hope. All of you will broadcast. All of you will matter. All of you will be eternal."

His voice was still gentle. Still The Night Caller's warm tones.

Even as he prepared to murder them.

"Who wants to be first?" Raymond asked. "Who wants to help me demonstrate that preservation is salvation?"

Standoff. Five people backed against walls, Raymond in the center with a syringe, twenty years of delusional certainty driving him forward.

And somewhere in the equipment room, Paulie's hand touched the transmitter controls.

Time was up.

The battle for survival was beginning.
