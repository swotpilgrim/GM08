# Chapter 1: The Road Up

The van's engine rattled as Jack downshifted around another hairpin turn. The 1976 Ford Econoline had seen better days—its blue paint oxidized to a dull gray, the suspension creaking with every pothole. But it had made the journey from New Hampshire without dying, which was more than Jack had expected when he'd volunteered to drive.

"How much further?" Leon leaned forward from the middle bench, his canvas jacket rustling. He'd been asking every twenty minutes for the past two hours.

"Sign back there said fifteen miles to the summit." Jack glanced at the rearview mirror, catching Marie's expression. She sat in the back, surrounded by manila folders and notebooks, her messenger bag open on her lap. "Give or take."

"Give or take?" Shelly's voice rose an octave. She'd claimed the passenger seat early, her purse clutched in her lap like a life preserver. "What does that mean?"

"Means mountain roads don't measure the same as regular roads." Paulie's voice came from behind Jack, calm and factual. "Switchbacks add distance. Could be fifteen miles as the crow flies, twenty-five by road."

"Great," Leon muttered. "Just great."

Jack smiled despite his own nerves. They'd been driving since sunrise, five strangers crammed into a van that smelled like old upholstery and peanut butter sandwiches. But they weren't quite strangers. They all knew Raymond's voice, that warm baritone playing requests between ten PM and six AM, making the darkness feel less empty.

"I still can't believe we won." Shelly twisted to face the others, her feathered blonde hair catching the afternoon light. "I entered every single week for two years. Every week! When the letter came, my mother thought it was a scam."

"My advisor thought the same thing." Marie didn't look up from her notes. "Pirate radio stations don't usually announce their locations to contest winners."

"That's what makes it special." Shelly's voice turned defensive. "Raymond trusts his listeners. He knows we understand what he's doing."

Jack felt the familiar tension building. Marie had been skeptical since they'd met at the rest stop outside Coopersville. Shelly had been defensive just as long.

"What is he doing?" Leon asked. "I mean, besides the obvious. Pirate station, illegal transmission, twenty years avoiding the FCC. What's the philosophy?"

"Connection." Jack navigated another turn, the road narrowing as pine trees pressed closer. "Radio is intimate. It's a voice in the dark when you're alone. Raymond talks about that sometimes, between songs. How loneliness is universal, but a shared frequency makes it bearable."

"That's beautiful," Shelly said softly.

"That's marketing," Marie countered. "Create emotional dependency, build loyal audience, sell them on the romance of outlaw broadcasting."

"You're here too," Shelly shot back.

"For my thesis. FCC regulation of pirate radio, case study of successful evasion tactics. This is research."

"Sure it is."

Jack cleared his throat. "What about you, Paulie? Why'd you enter?"

Paulie shifted, making the vinyl bench creak. "The sound quality. You ever really listen to The Night Caller? I mean with good headphones, proper equipment?"

"Every night," Shelly said.

"Then you've heard it. The audio is pristine. Better than commercial stations. I'm a sound engineer—I know what equipment costs, what skill it takes. A pirate broadcaster maintaining that quality for twenty years from an illegal mountaintop station?" He whistled low. "I want to see the setup."

"See it and what?" Leon asked. "You can't exactly publish specs for illegal equipment."

"No. But I can learn from it."

The van crested a rise. Valley below, mountains ahead, and between them—fog pooling in the hollows like spilled milk. Jack felt something tighten in his chest.

"Wow," Shelly breathed.

"October fog," Marie said. "Warm air, cold ground."

But she pulled out her camera anyway.

The road descended briefly before climbing again, steeper now. The van's engine groaned. Jack pressed the accelerator, feeling the transmission hunt for the right gear. Come on, he thought. Not now. Don't die now.

They passed a sign: Coopersville - 23 miles.

"That's the last town," Marie said. "According to the maps."

"Twenty-three miles back," Leon said slowly. "So whatever's ahead..."

"Is isolated," Jack finished. "Yeah."

Shelly turned the radio dial, searching through static. Country music dissolved into a preacher's shout, then static again, then the tail end of a weather report. She kept turning. More static. A burst of rock music, gone almost immediately. Static. Static. Static.

Then a voice, warm and familiar: "...and that was Fleetwood Mac with 'Dreams.' You're listening to The Night Caller, coming to you from somewhere in the mountains, keeping you company through the dark hours."

"There!" Shelly grabbed the dial, holding it steady. "There he is!"

The signal was clear—clearer than the commercial stations had been. Raymond's voice filled the van, intimate and close. Jack felt the same thing he always did: recognition. This was a voice that understood radio, how to pace words, how to create the illusion of conversation across the airwaves.

"It's only four-thirty," Marie frowned. "He doesn't broadcast until ten PM."

"Maybe it's a recording," Jack suggested. "Pre-show, something for local listeners."

"Or we're close enough now that we're picking up testing," Paulie said. "Engineers run test broadcasts to check equipment."

Raymond's voice continued: "Coming up next, we've got a special request from Jenny in Bristol. She wants to hear 'Stand By Me'—a classic. This one's for you, Jenny."

The music started, Ben E. King's voice smooth as honey.

They drove in silence, listening. The forest closed in tighter—oak and pine dense enough that the afternoon light turned green-gold. The road was gravel now, poorly maintained, full of ruts. Jack's hands ached from gripping the steering wheel.

"Anyone else think it's weird we haven't seen another car?" Leon's voice cut through the music.

Jack realized he was right. No cars. No houses. No mailboxes or power lines or any sign of human presence except the road itself, and even that seemed barely maintained.

"It's Friday afternoon," Shelly said. "People are at work."

"In Coopersville, sure. But twenty-three miles of mountain road and nothing?" Leon pulled out a small notebook. "No hunting camps, no ranger stations. Just forest."

"The station is illegal," Marie reminded him. "Isolated makes sense. Harder for the FCC to triangulate the signal."

"Or harder for anyone to find if something goes wrong," Leon muttered.

"Nothing's going to go wrong." Shelly's voice was sharp. "Raymond invited us. He wouldn't—this is supposed to be fun. Meeting him, seeing where he broadcasts, learning about radio. It's a contest prize, not a conspiracy."

Leon shrugged but didn't argue, going back to his notebook.

The road climbed steeper. Fog drifted across in wisps now, not thick enough to obscure visibility but present, ghostly. The temperature had dropped—Jack could feel it even inside the van. October in the mountains. He should have brought a heavier jacket.

"There." Paulie pointed ahead. "You see it?"

Through a gap in the trees: a tower. Thin, skeletal, rising two hundred feet, crowned with transmission equipment. It caught the late afternoon sun, metal gleaming against the darkening sky.

Jack's breath caught. After months of listening, wondering—there it was. The source where Raymond's voice began its journey across three states.

"Holy shit," he whispered.

"Language," Shelly said automatically, but she was leaning forward, eyes wide.

The road curved one final time, and the compound came into view.

A clearing, maybe two acres, carved from the forest at the mountain's peak. The transmission tower dominated, but around it: a squat cinderblock building, painted white but weathered gray, with a few small windows and a metal door. Next to it, a smaller structure—wooden, like a bunkhouse. Further back, partially hidden by trees, what looked like a generator shed. A chain-link fence encircled the whole compound, eight feet high, topped with three strands of barbed wire.

"For wildlife," Shelly said quickly. "Bears and things."

Marie didn't respond. She was staring at the fence, her camera forgotten.

Jack pulled the van through the open gate, gravel crunching under the tires, and stopped in front of the main building. He killed the engine. The sudden silence felt enormous, broken only by the tick of cooling metal and the sigh of wind through pine trees.

No one moved.

"So," Paulie said finally. "We're here."

Jack opened his door, cold air rushing in. He stepped out, his legs stiff from hours of driving, and looked around. The compound was empty. No cars, no lights in the windows, no sign of life except the tower, which hummed faintly with electricity.

The others climbed out, stretching, looking around. Shelly excited, Marie wary, Paulie curious, Leon tense.

"Hello?" Shelly called. "Mr. Peck? Raymond?"

Her voice echoed slightly, absorbed by the forest. No answer.

Jack walked to the main building's door. Locked. He peered through the window: darkness inside, shapes he couldn't quite make out. Equipment, maybe. Furniture. But no movement, no lights, no indication anyone was home.

"Maybe he's at the bunkhouse," Shelly suggested. "Getting it ready for us."

They walked over together, an unconscious clustering. The bunkhouse door was unlocked. Inside: five beds with clean sheets, a wood stove, supplies stacked neatly on shelves. Fresh water in containers. Everything prepared. But no Raymond.

"He was here," Marie said quietly. "Recently. This is set up for us."

"So where is he?" Jack asked.

The sun was setting now, fast the way it does in the mountains. Long shadows stretched across the compound, and the temperature dropped further. Jack pulled his denim jacket tighter, wishing again he'd brought something warmer.

From somewhere—the main building, maybe, or speakers mounted outside—came a soft click, then a hiss of static. Then a voice, warm and familiar:

"Welcome, friends. I'm so sorry I can't be there to greet you in person. An emergency required my attention in town, but I'll return tomorrow morning. Please make yourselves comfortable in the bunkhouse. Everything you need is there. Rest, explore, enjoy the mountain air. And tonight at ten, tune in. I'll be thinking of you."

The message ended. Static again, then silence.

The five of them stood in the gathering dark, looking at each other, the excitement that had carried them up the mountain curdling into something else. Something uncertain.

Jack thought about the road behind them—twenty-three miles without passing a single car. The fence, eight feet high with barbed wire. The tower humming with electricity. Raymond's voice coming from speakers they couldn't see.

"It's fine," Shelly said into the silence. "He'll be back tomorrow. It's fine."

But she didn't sound convinced.

And as the first stars appeared above the transmission tower, Jack felt the first real thread of unease settle into his gut, cold and persistent as the October wind.
