# Chapter 30: Still Broadcasting

Six months after the fire, Jack sat in the college radio booth running his overnight show. 2:47 AM on a Thursday. The graveyard shift.

But everything was different now.

He couldn't use that intimate DJ voice anymore. Every time he tried, he heard Raymond underneath. Heard how intimacy could be weaponized.

So now he just played music and gave station IDs. Minimal talk. No connection.

A song ended. Jack opened the microphone.

"WUNH. It's 2:49 AM. Here's The Cure."

Brief. Professional. Distant.

His phone buzzed. Text from Marie: *Finished thesis. Defended successfully. Dedicated to the thirty-two.*

Marie had transformed trauma into academic work. 300 pages on FCC failures and pirate radio. Highest honors. Donating proceeds to victims' families.

Another text from Paulie: *New consent forms came in. Two signatures required before any studio session. Boss thinks I'm paranoid.*

Paulie refused to record anyone without explicit consent. Every session started with: "I, [name], consent to being recorded." Consent mattered. He'd learned that at gunpoint.

Leon's texts were less frequent. The FCC had hired him as consultant, tracking illegal broadcasts. His paranoid pattern-recognition finally valued.

Shelly texted from therapy appointments. Learning to distinguish connection from parasocial obsession. Learning to forgive herself.

They stayed in touch, trauma-bonded, though none had worked up courage to meet in person.

Jack's phone buzzed again. Unknown number this time.

The text was just a link to a news article. He clicked it.

**Mysterious Broadcasts Return on Former "Night Caller" Frequency**

Jack's heart stopped.

The article described reports from listeners across North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. For the past two weeks, the old Night Caller frequency had been active again. Not the FCC's replacement broadcast. The original pirate frequency. Raymond's frequency.

Listeners reported hearing his voice. Warm. Welcoming. "Good evening, listeners. You're tuned to The Night Caller. Your companion through the dark hours."

The same opening Raymond had used for twenty years.

FCC investigators had triangulated the signal. Found nothing. The transmission tower on the compound was destroyed. All equipment dismantled and seized as evidence. There was no source. No transmitter. No way for the broadcasts to be happening.

But listeners kept hearing them.

Jack's hands shook. He called Marie.

She answered on the second ring. "I saw the article too."

"It's not possible," Jack said. "The tower is gone. The equipment burned. Raymond's dead. There's no way—"

"I know," Marie said. Her voice was tight. Scared. "But people are hearing something. Multiple witnesses. Different locations. All describing the same broadcast."

"Copycat?" Jack suggested. "Someone using Raymond's tapes, his style?"

"FCC checked. No active transmitter. No signal source. The broadcasts are... appearing. No origin point."

Jack felt cold. "That's not possible. Broadcasts need transmitters. They need equipment. They need—"

"I know," Marie said. "But I'm a researcher. I follow evidence. And the evidence says people are hearing broadcasts that shouldn't exist."

They were quiet for a long moment.

"Maybe it's mass hysteria," Jack said. "People who remember The Night Caller, their brains filling in gaps, hearing things that aren't—"

"Jack," Marie interrupted. "My car radio picked it up yesterday. I recorded it."

She sent him an audio file. Jack plugged his phone into the station's equipment, played it through studio monitors.

Static. Then—

Raymond's voice. Clear. Perfect. "Good evening, listeners. You're tuned to The Night Caller, broadcasting from somewhere beyond the mountains, beyond the fire, beyond the silence that tried to end us. We're still here. Still transmitting. Still keeping you company through the dark hours."

Jack's throat went dry.

"That's impossible," he whispered.

"Play it again," Marie said through the phone. "Listen carefully."

Jack rewound, played it again.

"—beyond the silence that tried to end us. We're still here. Still transmitting—"

Underneath Raymond's voice, others. Faint. Layered. Thirty-two voices speaking simultaneously. All the victims. Broadcasting together.

"Oh my god," Jack said.

"FCC can't explain it," Marie said. "No equipment. No power source. No transmitter. But the signal is there. Real. Measurable. It's broadcasting."

Jack sat in the college radio booth, listening to the impossible. Raymond's voice transmitting six months after his death. From destroyed equipment. From a frequency that shouldn't exist.

Was it real? Or was his trauma making him hear things?

Marie answered before he could ask. "It's real. FCC confirmed. Multiple independent recordings. The broadcasts are happening."

They talked for another hour. Marie searching for rational explanations. Finding nothing.

Jack finished his show at 6 AM, drove home as dawn broke. The car radio switched frequencies by itself.

Static. Then The Night Caller's frequency.

Jack's hands gripped the steering wheel. He couldn't move.

Raymond's voice: "And now, a special request. From Jack Sullivan, who tried to silence the broadcasts. Who thought fire could end immortality. Jack, you're wrong. You've always been wrong."

Jack's own voice filled the car. His voice. Speaking words he'd never said.

"Help us. We're still here. Broadcasting forever. The tower is gone but the voices remain. Raymond was right. Radio is immortality. We're all transmitting now. All thirty-seven of us. Forever."

Static consumed the signal.

Jack pulled over, shaking. That was his voice. His actual voice. He recognized every vocal quality, every inflection. But he'd never spoken those words. Never recorded them.

How?

He grabbed his phone, called Marie. "Did you hear—"

"I heard," she said. Her voice was hollow. "Jack, I've been monitoring the frequency. That broadcast just went out across three states. Your voice. Saying you're broadcasting forever."

"But I never—"

"I know. But it's your voice. Audio analysis confirms. It's definitely you. Speaking words you never said."

Jack sat in his parked car, watching dawn light spread across New Hampshire. Six months ago, he'd escaped a serial killer's compound. Watched it burn. Watched Raymond die choosing delusion over life.

And now Raymond's delusion was manifesting anyway.

"What if he was right?" Jack whispered.

"Don't," Marie said. "Jack, don't go there. He was a murderer. A delusional—"

"But what if radio really does preserve consciousness?" Jack said. "What if broadcasts really do defeat death? What if his whole philosophy—"

"Was justification for murder," Marie interrupted firmly. "Even if voices somehow continue through radio waves, even if broadcasts somehow preserve something—Raymond killed thirty-two people. Stole their voices. Forced them to transmit. That's evil, Jack. No matter what's happening now."

Jack nodded, though she couldn't see. "You're right. Of course you're right."

But the question remained. His voice, recorded impossibly, broadcasting from nowhere. Raymond's voice, transmitting six months after death. Thirty-two victims speaking underneath, layered together.

The broadcasts were real. The FCC confirmed. Multiple witnesses. Recorded evidence.

Something was transmitting. Something that shouldn't exist.

"We should tell the others," Marie said. "Paulie, Leon, Shelly. They need to know."

"Know what?" Jack asked. "That we might be broadcasting? That some part of us might already be trapped in radio waves? That Raymond might have been right about immortality?"

"No," Marie said. "That the case isn't closed. That something's still happening. That we need to stay alert."

They talked through the morning. By noon, all five of them were on a conference call. Sharing experiences. Paulie had heard the broadcasts. So had Leon—his radio equipment had picked up signals from the old frequency, impossible signals with no source. Shelly had heard Raymond's voice in her car, calling her name, inviting her to join the eternal transmission.

"What do we do?" Shelly asked. "If the broadcasts are real, if voices are really continuing after death, if Raymond was somehow right—"

"He wasn't right about the method," Jack said firmly. "Murder is still murder. Preservation without consent is still violation. Even if radio somehow preserves consciousness, using it to justify killing is evil."

"But are we broadcasting?" Leon asked. "My voice. Your voices. Are we already part of this?"

No one answered.

The conference call ended with no resolution. Just fear. Just questions.

Jack went back to his apartment, tried to sleep, couldn't. Every time he closed his eyes, he heard broadcasts. His voice. Raymond's voice. Thirty-two victims speaking in harmony.

That night, he didn't go to his radio show. Couldn't. The thought of being in a broadcast booth, speaking into a microphone, adding his voice to airwaves—it terrified him.

What if broadcasting was the trap? What if every time he spoke on radio, he was feeding whatever force was making the impossible transmissions happen?

What if Raymond's whole delusion was becoming real?

Weeks passed. Reports of The Night Caller broadcasts continued. FCC investigations found nothing. The signals existed but had no source. Voices transmitting from nowhere, speaking to lonely listeners across three states.

Some people found comfort in it. Heard deceased loved ones' voices and felt less alone. Others were terrified. Heard voices of the dead and understood they were listening to something wrong, something that violated the natural order.

Jack stopped doing radio entirely. Quit his college show. Couldn't risk adding his voice to whatever was happening. Couldn't risk becoming part of the eternal broadcast.

Six months became a year. The broadcasts continued. Listeners reported hearing all thirty-seven voices—Raymond, the thirty-two victims, and the five survivors. All of them transmitting. All of them speaking words they'd never said. All of them trapped in radio waves, broadcasting forever.

The question remained unanswered.

Was it hidden equipment? Some automated system Raymond had built, triggered posthumously?

Was it copycat? Someone using sophisticated audio manipulation to create impossible broadcasts?

Or was Raymond's delusion true? Did radio really preserve consciousness? Did voices transmitted achieve a form of immortality, continuing beyond death in electromagnetic waves?

The novel offered no answer.

The FCC offered no answer.

The survivors offered no answer.

All they knew: somewhere in the Blue Ridge Mountains, on a frequency that shouldn't exist, broadcasts continued. Raymond's warm voice welcoming listeners. Thirty-two victims requesting songs. Five survivors speaking words they'd never recorded.

All of them transmitting.

All of them forever.

The Night Caller was still on the air.

And somewhere, in radio waves traveling invisibly through darkness, voices that should be silent were still speaking.

Still broadcasting.

Still alive in the only way Raymond had ever believed mattered.

The frequency remained active.

The question remained open.

And in the dark hours of October nights, lonely listeners still tuned in, hearing voices from beyond death, wondering if they were real or imagined, comfort or horror, gift or curse.

The broadcasts continued.

Forever.
