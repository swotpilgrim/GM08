# Chapter 17: Booby-Trapped Broadcast

Paulie had been around broadcast equipment his whole life. He knew what normal looked like. This wasn't normal.

"Don't touch that." He caught Leon's hand six inches from the emergency frequency override panel.

"What's wrong with it?"

Paulie knelt, examining the panel with his flashlight. There—a thin wire running from the override switch to a small glass vial. "Mercury switch. You flip that switch, it sends 220 volts through whoever's touching it."

Leon jerked his hand back. "Jesus."

"Raymond didn't want anyone calling for help." Paulie traced the wire carefully. Flip the override, get electrocuted before you could finish transmitting.

Jack appeared in the equipment room doorway. "What did you find?"

"Booby traps." Paulie moved to the main transmitter, examining the housing. "Mercury switch on the emergency override—electrocution hazard. And this..." He pointed to the primary circuit breaker. "See those wires? They're cross-connected. You try to cut power to the station, it triggers a short circuit in the mixing board."

"Fire hazard," Jack said quietly.

"Instant." Paulie opened his toolkit. "The mixing board's surrounded by vinyl furniture, wood paneling, soundproofing foam. Place would go up like a tinderbox."

Marie joined them, notebook in hand. "Can you disable them?"

Paulie studied the equipment. Every access point he could think of—emergency frequency, main power, transmitter controls—had been rigged.

"Maybe," he said. "With time and the right approach. The mercury switch I can bypass if I can isolate the circuit without disturbing the vial. The fire hazard wiring needs to be disconnected in sequence—wrong order and it shorts anyway."

"How long?" Jack asked.

Paulie did the math. Trace every wire, map the circuits, identify all the traps, plan a safe sequence, execute without mistakes. "Eight hours. Maybe ten."

Leon paced to the window, nervous energy radiating off him. "We don't have ten hours. Raymond knows we found everything. He could come back any time."

"Then we don't use the equipment," Marie said. "We hike out. Twenty-three miles to Coopersville. Long walk but safer than electrocution or burning alive."

"If we leave, Raymond might run," Paulie said. "This compound has evidence, but without him, families might never know what happened."

Jack understood. "We need him here when authorities arrive."

"Which means we call them while we're still here," Leon said. "Can we send an SOS without touching the override?"

Paulie turned back to the equipment, looking at it with fresh perspective. Raymond had protected the obvious access points. But broadcast equipment was complex, layered. There were always redundancies, alternative pathways.

"Emergency override is booby-trapped," he said, thinking aloud. "But the transmitter itself has multiple inputs. We don't need the override if we can access the transmitter directly, feed in our own signal."

Marie leaned over his shoulder, following his logic. "Bypass the override entirely?"

"Patch directly into the transmitter." Paulie pulled the front panel off, revealing vacuum tubes and hand-wired circuits. "See those switches? They control the frequency. We manually reset them to emergency band, bypass the rigged override completely."

Jack knelt beside him. "What's the catch?"

There was always a catch. Paulie examined the access path. The frequency selectors were buried behind active circuitry, surrounded by high-voltage components. Reaching them meant working with power on, hand inside a live transmitter putting out enough wattage to reach three states.

"It's dangerous," Paulie admitted. "RF burns if I touch the wrong component. And we'd have to keep power running—can't shut down to work safely because the reboot sequence might trigger the fire trap."

Leon made a sound of frustration. "So hike and let Raymond escape, or risk electrocution, or get burned by a live transmitter?"

"Or we wait," Marie said. "Overpower Raymond, use his knowledge to access the equipment safely."

Paulie shook his head. "He's killed thirty-two people. He won't be easy to overpower."

Jack stood, pacing the equipment room. Through the window to the broadcast booth, they could see the empty DJ chair, microphone waiting. At 10 PM tonight, Raymond's pre-recorded broadcast would start again. His warm voice filling the mountain compound, talking about loneliness and connection while they stood surrounded by evidence of his murders.

"What if we don't try to call for help yet?" Jack said slowly. "What if we use the equipment differently?"

Paulie looked up. "How?"

"Raymond's been listening to us through hidden microphones. He knows we found everything. But we could... talk to him. Use the broadcast. Draw him back here on our terms instead of his."

"Psychological warfare," Marie said. "You go on-air, address him directly."

Jack nodded. "I'm a DJ. I know how to use a microphone, how to construct a message. If I can get to him, make him engage with us, maybe we can control the confrontation. Buy time to either escape or disable these traps properly."

Leon looked skeptical. "You think you can out-think a serial killer with twenty years of experience manipulating people through radio?"

"No," Jack said honestly. "But I understand what he's doing. The intimacy of radio, the parasocial connection. I use those same techniques on my overnight show. Maybe I can get inside his head, make him respond."

Paulie considered it. The plan had merit. If Jack could engage Raymond through broadcast, provoke a response, they might learn where he was, what he was planning. And it bought time to work on the equipment without rushing.

"I can make the broadcast booth safe for you," Paulie said. "The microphone circuits aren't trapped—Raymond needs them functional for his programming. You can go on-air without risk. But you can't touch the transmitter controls or the emergency override."

"Just voice," Jack said. "That's all I need."

Marie flipped to a fresh page in her notebook. "We need a strategy. What do you say to him? How do you provoke a response without making him run?"

They spent an hour planning. Jack would go on-air during a song break, speak directly to Raymond. Not accusatory—therapeutic. Probe his psychology.

Meanwhile, Paulie would map the traps. Leon would monitor for Raymond. Marie would prepare evidence they could hide on their bodies.

At 9:30 PM, they took positions. The generator hummed. The equipment room's vintage gear glowed with warm tube light. Through the broadcast booth window, Jack sat at the microphone, headphones on, watching the program timer count down to song transition.

Paulie worked at the transmitter housing, tracing circuits with his multimeter. Every wire was purposeful, every connection deliberate. Raymond had built this system with love and precision. It showed in the craftsmanship—hand-soldered joints, careful wire routing, meticulous labeling.

"He's good," Paulie muttered. "Really good. This equipment is twenty years old and it's maintained like new. Better than new. Better than most commercial stations."

Leon watched over his shoulder. "You sound impressed."

"I am." Paulie hated admitting it. "Impressed and horrified. He's a monster, but he's also a brilliant engineer. This transmitter setup? I've never seen a pirate station with this level of sophistication. He's built something that could broadcast forever if maintained."

"Radio immortality," Leon said quietly.

At 10 PM, Raymond's voice came through the external speakers. Warm, measured, intimate. "Good evening, listeners. You're tuned to The Night Caller, your companion through the dark hours. I've got a beautiful show planned for you tonight..."

Paulie felt his skin crawl. That voice had comforted him on long drives, during late studio sessions when he was the only person in the building. He'd trusted that voice. They all had.

In the broadcast booth, Jack waited. Forty-five minutes into the program, a song started—"Dream a Little Dream of Me" by The Mamas & the Papas. Four minutes and sixteen seconds. Jack's window.

He opened the microphone.

"Raymond Peck. I know you're listening. We need to talk about Margaret. About the thirty-two people buried around your tower."

Paulie stopped working. Jack's voice was calm, professional. Not threatening.

"I'm a DJ too. Overnight shift at a college station. I understand radio intimacy—being a voice in the dark. Is that what you felt with Margaret? Is that why you needed to preserve her voice?"

The song played underneath. The Mamas & the Papas singing about dreams.

"The people you recorded trusted you. They came to visit, to meet the voice that made them feel less alone. But Raymond, preservation requires consent. They didn't choose this."

No response. Just the pre-programmed broadcast continuing.

"We found the journals. The victim selection notes. Twenty years of work. You understand loneliness better than anyone. Because you live it too, don't you?"

Marie appeared beside Paulie. They watched Jack lean into the microphone.

"Margaret's death broke something in you. You found a way to defeat death through technology. Radio waves traveling forever, voices that never stop. I understand the appeal. But the thirty-two people buried outside didn't get to choose immortality. You chose for them."

The song ended. Raymond's pre-recorded voice returned: "That was The Mamas & the Papas with 'Dream a Little Dream.' Now let's take a request from Jenny in Bristol who's been feeling lonely tonight..."

Jenny's voice—dead four years according to the obituaries—requesting "Stand By Me."

Jack leaned back from the microphone. They waited.

Ten PM became eleven. The broadcast continued its programmed routine. No response from Raymond. No sign he'd heard. But Paulie knew better. Raymond had rigged hidden microphones throughout the compound. He'd booby-trapped his equipment against tampering. He was listening. Somewhere in the dark mountains, Raymond Peck was hearing every word.

"He's out there," Leon said. "Deciding what to do."

Paulie returned to the transmitter, working by flashlight to avoid disturbing the delicate circuits. If they could just access the frequency selectors, bypass the rigged override, get one emergency signal out to the rangers...

But it would take time. Time they might not have.

Outside, fog settled into the valleys. The tower rose 200 feet into the night, broadcasting Raymond's voice to three states. Somewhere in the dark, the man himself listened. Planning. Preparing.

And in the equipment room, Paulie worked on, trying to turn Raymond's own technology against him before the killer came home.
